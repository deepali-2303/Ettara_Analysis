Its been more than 2 days yet nothing has been done on anyones part all they say is to send mail. If I ordered today and got the wrong order today because of you or Swiggy then why am I being asked to send emails??? I did not pay for some basic cold coffee that I can make at home.

I have been a great fan of Tim Hortons Middle East & europe... you guys are not even close to that taste and quality.... people coming here giving you 5 stars are all social media influencers and show offs without knowing the quality of a great brand... I had ordered an americano as you guys dont serve brewed coffee and it was nothing but hot water. Nescafe would have tasted better than your so-called arabica coffee.... And then ordered a chicken bagal which was very hard to chew and had to give my entire energy to break it into a bite..... had to throw the entire bagal.....which was a waste. Over all would give you a minus if had an option.....

Heres a detailed breakdown of my visit: ** Food: 4/5 ** The food at Tim Hortons is a real treat for the taste buds. I started with their Frozen French Vanilla, and it did not disappoint. It had a smooth and rich vanilla flavor with just the right hint of coffee notes. Served over ice, it was a refreshing way to kick off my meal. For the main course, I tried two different sandwiches. First up was the Chicken & Cheese Melt Sandwich. The sourdough bread was the perfect canvas for the chunky spread of chicken, Cheddar, and grated cheese. It was grilled to perfection with a touch of garlic confit, and the combination of flavors was delightful. Next, I ventured into spicier territory with the Spicy Chicken Melt Sandwich. Again, the sourdough bread was spot on, but the addition of BBQ chicken, green chili, and sriracha sauce gave it a nice kick. While it was enjoyable, I found it slightly less impressive than the Chicken & Cheese Melt. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I ordered a Timbit Box of 10. This assortment of mini donut balls, known as Timbits, was a delightful mix of flavors. The blueberry-filled and chocolate-filled Timbits were my personal favorites, and the caramel crumble and cookies & cream varieties were equally scrumptious. I couldnt leave without trying one of Tim Hortons classic donuts, so I opted for the Boston Cream. This classic was filled with a luscious Boston Cream and dipped in a generous amount of chocolate sauce. While it was tasty, it didnt quite reach the same level of excellence as the sandwiches and Frozen French Vanilla. ** Service: 4/5 ** The service at Tim Hortons was efficient and friendly. The staff took my order promptly, and my food and beverages were prepared quickly. The employees were attentive and made sure I had everything I needed throughout my meal. ** Atmosphere: 3.5/5 ** Tim Hortons is more of a casual, grab-and-go kind of place rather than a sit-down restaurant. The atmosphere is clean and functional, with a focus on fast service. While it may not be the ideal spot for a romantic dinner, its a great place to grab a quick bite to eat or enjoy some coffee and donuts with friends. In conclusion, my visit to Tim Hortons was a satisfying experience. The food, particularly the sandwiches and Frozen French Vanilla, stood out as highlights. The service was efficient, and while the atmosphere was more on the casual side, it served its purpose well. If youre in the mood for tasty sandwiches and delightful coffee beverages, Tim Hortons is a solid choice.",4 months ago,2023-10-17 14:02:37.190110,"Hi Arzan, thank you for sharing your review, and we genuinely appreciate your feedback.

For the first half of the bagel, I made the mistake of applying the cheese little by little before each bite. By the time the first half was finished it occurred to me that that was a very inefficient way of eating it. So, for the second half I applied the entirety of the remaining cream cheese thickly onto the open half of the half-bagel and only then began eating, which made eating it so much easier and made the experience much more enjoyable. The thickness of the cream cheese also was perfect. It looked very hard but when you spread it on the bagel it spreads very smoothly; the firmness of the bagel also helps when spreading them cream cheese cheeks as it (the bagel) retains its shape even if you press hard on it during the process. The visual factor of seeing the knife s zigzag sharp edge creating crisp lines on the cream is also an additional element which adds to the satisfaction of the whole experience. Seeing the lines created by the sharp edge of the knife on the cheese reminded me of those zen sand gardens which have those beautiful and calming patterns on the sand. If you are having bagel and cream cheese for the first time then make sure you eat it the right way from the start. Also, make sure you sit in a place that has high tables. They have lot of low tables which looks good aesthetically but makes it really hard to eat/drink from it.

ChIJpUd6bdXJ5zsROgojdto2ahU,Tim Hortons,7b2216241c95aa5fd1cda7230832d556,3,"The business was founded by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League, from 1949 until his death in an auto crash in 1974.[14][15] The first Tim Horton restaurant was located in North Bay, Ontario and sold hamburgers.[16] The chains first donut store opened on May 17, 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name Tim Horton Donuts.[17] The name was later abbreviated to Tim Hortons and then changed to Tim Hortons without the possessive apostrophe. Soon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former police constable in Hamilton. In 1965, Joyce took over the fledgling Tim Horton Donut Shop at 65 Ottawa St N. By 1967, after opening two additional stores, Joyce and Horton became full partners. Upon Hortons death in 1974, Joyce bought out the Horton familys shares for $1 million and took over as sole owner of the existing chain of 40 stores, quickly and aggressively expanding the chain in both geography and product selection. The 500th store opened in 1991.[18] Ron Joyces aggressive expansion of the Tim Hortons business resulted in major changes to the Canadian coffee and donut restaurant market. Many independent donut shops and small chains were driven out of business, while Canadas per-capita ratio of donut shops surpassed that of all other countries.[19] The Horton and Joyce partnership carried on, with the marriage of Joyces son, Ron Joyce Jr., and Hortons eldest daughter, Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce, who were joint owners of Tim Hortons franchises in Cobourg, Ontario until 2023 when the couple retired after 37 years.[20] 1990 2002: Name change and growth Edit Tim Hortons logo as used in the mid-1990s The company had originally been incorporated as Tim Donut Limited.[11] By the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd. This was an effort by the company to diversify the business, removing the primary emphasis on donuts, and continuing the expansion of the menu options as consumer tastes broadened.[18] Some older locations retain signage with the companys name, including a possessive apostrophe, despite the fact that the official styling of the companys name has been Tim Hortons without an apostrophe for at least a decade.[21] The company had removed the apostrophe after signs using the apostrophe was interpreted by some to be breaking the language sign laws of the Province of Quebec in 1993.[22] The removal of the apostrophe allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.[23] Although a number of Quebec locations have bilingual menu boards, the decision to have both Canadian official languages represented is left to the discretion of individual franchise owners. Some Quebec locations have French-only menu boards. It is the strong recommendation to all the Quebec restaurants from the TDL Group Corporation that they post menu boards in both English and French in accordance with the standards being enforced by the Office quebecois de la langue francaise.[24] Merger with Wendys Edit A Tim Hortons/Wendys joint restaurant in Markham, Ontario In 1992, the owner of all Tim Hortons and Wendys Restaurants in Prince Edward Island, Daniel P. Murphy, decided to open new franchise outlets for both brands in the same building in the town of Montague. Murphy invited Joyce and Wendys chairman Dave Thomas to the grand opening of the combo store, where the two executives met for the first time. Murphys success with combining coffee and donuts with Wendys fast food led to the August 8, 1995, acquisition of and merger with TDL Group by Wendys International, Inc., an American company, which lasted until 2009.[25] The sale was widely commented on in the media. In 1995, the Toronto Star had a column reflecting on Tim Hortons selling out to Wendys with the spectacle of another great Canadian icon...gone to Yankee burgerfat.[26] 2002 2006: Regaining independence Edit Tim Hortons franchises spread rapidly and eventually overtook McDonalds as Canadas largest food service",5 months ago,2023-09-17 14:02:46.829792,,,,0,405,3939,True,,

Nestled amidst the bustling streets of the city, this franchise brings a taste of Canadian flavors and comforting ambiance to the local scene. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by the familiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the warm ambiance that Tim Hortons is known for. The menu boasted a variety of options. I opted for a  cappuccino ,  tim chocolate shake , and  rich truffle slice . The coffee was smooth and well-balanced, a perfect companion for a quick catch-up with a friend or a peaceful moment alone. While the menu included a decent selection of both beverages and food items, I found myself missing some of the seasonal specialties that Tim Hortons is famous for, such as their Tim Hortons Roll Up the Rim contest and various holiday-themed treats. It would be wonderful to see these additions in the future. The seating area was comfortable, ideal for casual meetings or a leisurely afternoon spent reading a book. The bright and cheerful interior, adorned with hints of Canadian culture, added to the overall experience. However, I did notice that during peak hours, the place could get a bit crowded, leading to longer wait times for both ordering and receiving food. It would be great if they could streamline their service during busy periods. All in all, Tim Hortons in Mumbai offers a pleasant escape into Canadian flavors and culture. The cozy ambiance, friendly staff, and a taste of their signature offerings make it a delightful spot to enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack. While there is room for improvement in terms of service efficiency during peak times, I left with a contented palate and a sense of having experienced a slice of Canada in the heart of Mumbai.",5 months ago,2023-09-17 14:02:49.661621,"Thank you so much for this wonderful review, Ashwini!

The service is fine, and the vibes are a cool cafe type which is quite nice. Overall, not a place I would recommend or take someone to. P.S.

Again a terrible and unprofessional way of dealing with a mishap.

So they don t know the recipe. All in all they DIDNOT have anything in the menu as Tim hortons. It s highly priced. So I highly suggest to not to go there just for the sake of its name.

There was no table service, considering that you charge 300/- for a crossaint, the least you can do is give me service? After placing the order, a pager token was given to us.

The pastries were terrible, lacking the freshness and flavor that one would expect. The coffee, often raved about, was no more than sugar shots that left me longing for the richness and depth of flavor I anticipated. Service, unfortunately, was equally lackluster. The servers mixed up orders, leading to confusion and unnecessary delays. It was clear that the staff was struggling to keep up with the demand, and this affected the overall customer experience. Considering my underwhelming experience at Tim Hortons in Lokhandwala, I cannot recommend this establishment. There are far better options in the area for those seeking a quality coffee and dining experience.",4 months ago,2023-10-17 14:03:30.627561,"Hi Mr. Shaikh! were sorry to hear about your experience.

Seriously, that pastry could write a memoir about how awesome it is, and Id read it. But lets talk wait times oh, the wait times. I had enough time to ponder the existential crises of my life while waiting for that cup of joe. Its as if each coffee bean is being individually interviewed before making it into the grinder. And our baristas? Bless their hearts, they could use a training montage. Think Rocky, but with espresso machines instead of punching bags. Still, despite the time warp and the barista learning curve, the coffee and pastry did not disappoint. They were the saving grace, like finding a Rs 500 bill in an old pair of jeans. Id give it a solid 7 out of 10. Why? Because the flavors were the heroes of this story, swooping in to save the day, while everything else was, lets say, a work in progress. Would I go back?

Was a bit oily like spring rolls, but it was a good delight. The green chutney that came along was out of the world and super delicious, just like typical Punjabi Ghar ka chutney. BBQ Chicken Piadina was super flavourful and delicious. The chicken was soft and fresh, nicely cooked in flavourful sauce. The Piadina was enough cheesy and creamy. Onions and green chillies added a nice punch. We also tried and loved all four flavours of Timbits. Loved them so much that we took take aways for the family as well.

Have compared my recent experience to that of Starbucks since I have been a fan since it s launch in India. Sharing a detailed review below: Food: A variety of good options. Tried multiple things here. They have adapted the taste as per Indian palate. The prep time is a bit long since I have experienced Starbucks which is much faster. Ambience: The is decent, basic and standard as expected from an international brand. The best part is comfy open air seating. Hygiene: This is a miss big time. Especially the washrooms. I have never experienced unclean toilets in Starbucks with my over 100+ visits in multiple cities. This one was unclean and smelly. Had spent almost 5-6 hours working from here. Didn t notice anyone cleaning it up. Also, nothing specific to the store. But the mobile range is poor if you plan to sit inside. Seems to be some network issue inside the store. Made it difficult to operate from there. The other observation was that though the store wasn t busy as much on a Friday afternoon. But around 50% of the tables were occupied by Tim staff. There was food trails and tasting happening, areas manager was taking some call. New joiners we re taking up calls from customer facing area. Making it hard for me to find a table with charging capacity as most of them were already being used. There is long way to go for Tim to level up and match up to Starbucks in India.",6 months ago,2023-08-17 14:03:50.750137,"Hello Talvinder, we apologize for the negative experience you had with us.

Unfortunately the experience of Tim Horton was not at all on par with the ones I experienced in the past. The French vanilla I bought was full on sugary drink tasting like the Bournvita drink which is given to children. There Ginger bread hot chocolate and lemon ice tea weren t that good either. The cafe was dirty, the staff don t bother cleaning the tables promptly. I would not recommend this cafe as it tarnishes the image of the original Tim Horton. Hope the Tim Hortons team takes action about it. I also visited Tim Horton earlier this month in Chandigarh, these guys need to take a page from them.
