I drove with my family in heavy rains for more than 10 kms reading such vibrant reviews of the place, their coffee serving experience and snacks etc. But all in vain. If you are someone who craves good coffee in good atmosphere then this IS NOT the place. First let me clarify that its a part of Juhi residency hotel and is a place with only two to four people to sit. Not not all the coffees are served for tasting as mentioned by someone. We were not even asked for any customisation. Snacks options are very few and all are ready made. So not much there In the locality there are much better coffee places which serve the right dose of coffee snacks and ambience so better to head elsewhere",7 months ago,2023-07-17 00:35:18.212098,,,,0,11,,False,,

Beating all the competitors in the same lane by just selling really good coffee at really good price too. Hazelnut frappe is my favourite but I guess am the coffee s are the best here. They also give banana chips before serving the coffee to give a South Indian feel . It is owned by a southindian and has a South Indian theme to the name too. One suggestion will be please stop giving plastic water bottles for free to all the customers. Gove regular water to customers in a glass and if anyone asks for a packaged water then you can give them Bisleri.

Pros: loved the filter coffee ,it was nice and strong and ofcourse piping hot - they provide with a sweetner of choice sugar or jaggery . Their utensils shine ,as if drinking in a cup of gold . You can also opt for a bigger portion of the filter coffee if the regular mug is not enough for you  . The coffee is served with a small portion of assorted banana chips that are fab! They also serve miniature bottled water however I dont know if thats charged or free since we didnt drink any water. The staff recommended a papparoti bun which is a mildly sweetened bun with some cinnamon powder. It compliments the coffee really well and was completely melt in your mouth. Definetly a must try. Cons: its a small space so they have only 2 tables inside. The rest of the seating is out on the footpath which isint to bad if the weather is great and there isnt much of honking - both of which are not as common in Mumbai. The team did mention that they are working on the seating issue so hopefully that shud be sorted soon .. however , none of these should deter you to try the stuff here .",a year ago,2023-02-17 00:35:24.752243,,,,1,53,89,True,,
