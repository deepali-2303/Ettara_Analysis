Soundblind,"They just have 2 tables inside the hotel, 80 percent of the space is outside. So basically they've put tables and chairs on the footpath by the highly trafficed road. Very noisy.

Raghavi Iyengar,"We stumbled upon this place after a chaotic flight from Bangalore and it was just what we needed- some quiet and the welcoming aroma of great coffee. The staff were really sweet and helpful and extremely attentive. They gave us little samplers and also showed us the grind size when we bough coffee from them(they could tell we were picky). The snacks are just the perfect size and very well priced. Their veg calzone and baked vada pav were excellent. With coffees we had the mocha frappe, filter coffee frappe and the Irish americano, all very yummy. The service is not the speediest, so come in when you have some time to slow down and shut the world out. But big shout out Sabina, Kundan and Priti for the great service!!
