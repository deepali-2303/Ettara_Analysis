Vinil Shah,The place is very very good and peaceful. The staff is very good. Every coffee that you order is first given for tasting to know it and later served which is a very good thing. They give chips along with the order which is again a nice gesture.

Katha Mehta,"Having tried so many coffee places, this is easily the best place! The coffee is absolutely delicious and they adjust the taste to your preference by allowing you to taste test it. I would recommend the Vietnamese Cold Coffee and the Hazelnut Frappe.The banana chips are also simply so good, crispy and little to no oil.

Shreekara Udupa,If you are in Juhu and you want really good coffee this is the place. Beating all the competitors in the same lane by just selling really good coffee at really good price too. Hazelnut frappe is my favourite but I guess am the coffee’s are the best here.They also give banana chips before serving the coffee to give a South Indian feel . It is owned by a southindian and has a South Indian theme to the name too.One suggestion will be please stop giving plastic water bottles for free to all the customers. Gove regular water to customers in a glass and if anyone asks for a packaged water then you can give them Bisleri.

Pooja arora,"Really wanted to try this place since a while now and finally managed to do it on a cold windy evening.Pro's: loved the filter coffee ,it was nice and strong and ofcourse piping hot - they provide with a sweetner of choice sugar or jaggery . Their utensils shine ,as if drinking in a cup of gold . You can also opt for a bigger portion of the filter coffee if the regular mug is not enough for you  . The coffee is served with a small portion of assorted banana chips that are fab! They also serve miniature bottled water however I dont know if that's charged or free since we didn't drink any water.The staff recommended a papparoti bun which is a mildly sweetened bun with some cinnamon powder. It compliments the coffee really well and was completely melt in your mouth. Definetly a must try.Cons: it's a small space so they have only 2 tables inside. The rest of the seating is out on the footpath which isint to bad if the weather is great and there isn't much of honking - both of which are not as common in Mumbai. The team did mention that they are working on the seating issue so hopefully that shud be sorted soon .. however , none of these should deter you to try the stuff here .",4,a year ago,3,1,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105545609291814393684?hl=en-US,Local Guide·53 reviews·89 photos,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVL2yCV1d5fzP4ldetfgRMeH2IDoSTpVHBgDV_U1g-3f_k=s40-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100,"https://www.google.com/search?hl=en-IN&gl=in&q=Ettarra+Coffee+House,+boutique+hotel,+Ground+floor,+Juhu+residency,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra+400049&ludocid=5689877233278937960&lsig=AB86z5WztwL__ShtRJ-dqupaSttv&_rs_=1#lrd=0x3be7c9d682f55cd5:0x4ef68132892c6b68,1"
