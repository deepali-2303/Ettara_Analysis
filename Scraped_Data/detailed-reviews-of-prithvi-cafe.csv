Review
Irish coffee is to die for...
"Great atmosphere, food is alright, nothing great. We order Kulcha Panner Cheeses chole and peach drink as per the suggestion by the staff. But the taste was avg. I would like to try something different on the menu next time. For now"
"Food and vibe here is too good. Must visit anytime of the day or year, will not be disappointed. Food"
Nice place to hangout. Mast khana
Hm very good
The food was good and the price was also very affordable.
The food is tasty and the ambience is amazing - gives a cozy youthful vibe! Personal favourite is Chhole kulche and their coolers.
Food was good but getting a seat will take time. Also I went to try their Irish coffee but it was not available when I went
Pretty chill vibe! Food is good and affordable
The experience was awesome.. Food
"Located with the Prithvi theatre premises in Juhu, this is one of the most pocket-friendly places in Mumbai. The food is good, the atmosphere is always buzzing. Theres also a library nearby."
A really crowded and well known place between the youngsters with lip smaking paratha and nachos . And also dont forget to try their shakes
"Amazing Place! ,"
Prithvi cafe has a vibe . Reasonable price food and pav bhaji awsome classic . Vibe s so awsome . loved it service is not that great rest vibe food awsome . Vegetarian options: Pav bhaji awsome
"Cozy atmosphere, nice hangout open air spot, good place to chill in pleasant weather. Young crowd and affordable food. Except wait time as they don t take booking. Food is average, service is good but atmosphere is best. Must try for outsiders if they like art."
200 se 400 me hojayega sacchi ??
Its too much good
Pocket friendly and good ambience. Kulchas are a must try. Its next to juhu beach so you can chill at the beach later on.
"Best place, EVER! And the staff is FANTASTIC. Its like a second home to me.      I always have a bit to eat or something to drink here, when passing by or when Im here for a play at Prithvi Theatre. 5 Stars Food"
"Awesome vibe, suber fast service, usually fully booked so you have to wait for a table, but its worth it and pretty economical. Staff was also very friendly Famous Dish : Amritsari Kulcha Food : 5/5"
Right beside the well known Prithvi Theatre.. an open-air type seating arrangement.. popular with young people.. it has a chilled vibe.. not sure if the experience is equally enjoyable in summer though.. overall a good place to hangout with your friends
Young and energetic atmosphere! Very humble and smooth service!
Tasty food Must try the chole kulchas
Nice cafe with outdoor seating next to prithvi theatre. A bit costly on the pocket but food was good. Decor and lighting at night is soothing. Attracts crowd. Majority visiting to see the shows.
"Loved it totally, their chai was the best chai I had in Mumbai."
Greate experience
Fantabulous
Used to be one of the favourite place. Visited this place after long time. Had terrible experience. None of the food option was same as it used to be. Not even their tea. May not visit again.
Wonderful food. Very friendly staff. Lively ambiance. Budget food. Well managed. Food : 5/5
"Best place to chill and quick bites, kadak tea, bakery items, parathas, pizza, pasta...."
"Amazing food, vibes and decor. Only downside is long waiting times and extremely slow service. The QR menu is a pain Vegetarian options: Great collection of vegetarian dishes Dietary restrictions: Not too accommodating for jains and vegans. Barely 2-3 options"
Good
"Overall it was fine , although side dips quantity was very tiny but vibes of these place is unmatchable compared to any other"
"Great food.  Quite busy.  Reasonable prices.  Capuccino and kadak chai very good.  Dont miss the cheese croissant.   Enjoy the atmosphere,  the rush, the energy of a young and vibrant place."
Classic place . Irish coffee out off this world.  Best place for talk with your self
Fantastic place
Great place to hangout before you catch a play or a concert. Kunal Kapoor does a good job.
Food
Loved the vibe. A great place to chill out with friends!
Good place to hangout with friends
Kadak chal mast

Make sure to reserve in advance through their scanner. The chut chur naan is best.
Beautiful vibe and great food!
Nostalgia and awe surround the place. Food is good and prices are which brings a smile to your face
Great food. Wonderful atmosphere. Service needs to match up.
"I visited there with my close friends for my post birthday celebration dinner and it was all worth it! Such a calming and lovely ambience. Its rustic vibe felt homely. We had Aloo and Paneer Kulcha, and Mix sauce Pasta, with Watermelon Mojito, Tropical Iced Tea and KitKat Shake. It was all so yummmm and so reasonably priced! Must visit!!! If you can, also catch up on their shows in the Prithvi Theatre :)"
Hot Chocolate was nice!
"People also ask How do you describe a cafe? A cafe setting is known as a casual social environment where you can find people reading newspapers and magazines, playing board games, studying or chatting with others about current events."
Lovely place for
Very expensive...
Best place to chill out with friends
Horrible experience
"Waiting time is too long, service is very slow"
"Fantastic place. Great food, ambiance and menu options. Food taste is unforgettable. We had Aloo kulcha with chhole, aloo paratha with dal makhani, Irish coffee, Kahva and Rustom tea. Ordering experience is convenient as one has to scan the qr code which open the menu options with table no, select the option and place the order, order service is very quick and payment can be done online and offline mode both. With Prithvi theater and book shop, Third Wave Coffee nearby with market on the main road, it is a go to place without any second thought. There is no parking facility though so one has to make the arrangements accordingly on the main road. Overall a memorable experience."
Great experience
"Ambience was good, though no place to sit. Terrible coffee for a place with cafe in their name. Had pav bhaji too, was okayish. Not worth the money."
"It is a great place!!! Vibe-too good Food-awesome Price-very much affordable Service-on time and very good It is surrounded with so much of greenery which calms your mind. The service was very quick. We had chai, KitKat shake, watermelon mojito, amritsari kulcha, pav bhaji, pasta and kulhad pizza. Everything was perfect, it was not like that xyz has less sugar or more sugar or something was bland, no not at all. Trust me I like the place more than the expensive restaurants of BKC. Must visit if you like good food at affordable price that too with a quick service."
Hummus was good. A big no for the pizza and pesto spaghetti.
Such a lovely place.. Best place to hang around with natural surroundings
"Amazing taste, Amritsari chole kulche is worth a try"
Nice
All very good
Loved it
Had to wait there for more than 40 minutes. Too much waiting time. They also have increased the prices of food items. Lesser quantity and more expensive pricing comparatively. Just loved the ambience. Must visit at night post sunset only for ambience. Parking: You need to park at Juhu. No parking available at Prithvi Cafe.
Nice and vibrant place with decent food
"An eclectic food haven, where sizzling aromas dance amidst vibrant plating, a bustling spot that caters to every craving with its diverse culinary symphony."
Great variety of good food Lovely atmosphere. Food
Good food at pocket friendly rates.
Paneer kulcha and chhole was very good
"The vibes are beautiful. A place with no fancy arrangements, no loud music. A subtle and calm environment, people in groups, couple and family makes you feel at ease. Their seating arrangement is so simple and the food is fab. Must try blueberry cheesecake with subtle sugar, veg biryani and their kulchas.   Such a serene spot to be at."
Good
Live show itself is an amazing experience. Best part is time management. Time bound events. Food
"Visited Prithvi cafe on weekend Saturday. It was crowded and full. Waited for around an hour to get a table. We ordered Paneer kulcha, pizzas with 2 different drinks. Everything was served simultaneously while the drinks could have served quite early. Taste wise, kulcha was good."
Overhyped ....no doubt food here is delicious but expensive too maybe because of the locality...you will have to wait here maybe 30 40 mins in  the waiting area then they will call you and arrange a seat for you though its good but the waiting system was waste of time .
Great ambience and tasty food at reasonable prices
Such a nice vibe !!! N food is also amazing..
Vegetarian options: Try to put more vegetarian options Food
Awesome place!!!
The food was good & d rates were reasonable. Ambience is also nice & quirky. But it takes around half an hour to get a table even on weekdays.
"Beautiful setting and superb food. The quantity and taste are very good. We ordered 2 Irish Coffees, Amritsari kulcha, Butter chicken meal, Patrani fish finger, Hot n Spicy chicken pizza and Tiramisu. The Irish coffees were very good, the Meal was sumptuous. There is no need to take extra chole etc as the quantity of chole given with the kulchas is quite good. The kulchas were soft, filled with tasty potato filling and had chole, achar and dahi included. The pizza was tasty and had a nice thin crust. The red velvet Brownie that came with the meal seemed slightly overbaked and on the harder side. The food and the ambience are overall very good and worth going back for."
"I love this place and have been here for atleast 7 to 10 times, but everytime I go here it always has a waiting of atleast 30 mins. The place is an open cafe kind of vibe and due to their space constraints they will combine your seating with other people. But the overall vibe & atmosphere is superb. Its a value for money kind of place and a must go."
Lovely vibe!
"Prithvi Cafe in Juhu is a gem   not just for its great food but for the super ambiance and warm staff. A must-visit for the chance to encounter theatre actors, adding a unique charm to the place. The vibrant atmosphere exudes positive vibes, and despite the popularity, the staff manages waiting times efficiently, typically ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. The competitive pricing enhances the overall appeal. Prithvi Cafe is a delightful haven where excellent cuisine meets a cultural experience. Highly recommended!"
"Took my parents there for an experience but it had very limited options for for them. Too crowded and no proper waiting area. Ambience is good though and you get priority if you are dressed seemingly affluent. A place for youngsters. Would rate 3.5/5 overall. Kid-friendliness: Not very kid friendly, no kids chairs available, no proper smoking place so people smoke wherever they want and the cooking smoke also can get a little irritating for a few tables"
"Tasty food,quick service, friendly staff,seating arrangement is crude. Air circulation good,price 15% high."
"Tasty food,nice ambience good service,atmosphere"
F&B tastes just average
Cafe got many options and is quite affordable. Food is tasty. The ambience of the place is very lively. It s quite a happening place. Wheelchair accessibility: It is wheelchair accessible from the main road
We ordered cheese kulcha paratha (5/5) Jalapeno cheese ball (5/5) Cheese pav bhaji (4/5) Passion fruit ice tea (2/5) Blueberry cooler (4/5) staff was friendly
Visited the cafe: must try the Irish coffee and the bun maska.
"Affordable, tasty and delicious food place in Juhu. This cafe has one of the best ambience in terms of crowd, staff, and location. They serve one of the best fish and chips in Mumbai. Must try at this place: 1. Chocolate croissant 2. Egg bhurji pav 3. Butter chicken roll (Add eggs) 4. Fish and Chips (Must)"
"This place is a vibe. Does it have the best food? No. You might have to wait in really long queues before you even get a seat in the scorching Mumbai heat. But it is a vibe. Prithvi feels like home - youll find people of all age groups, adrak tea, amazing piping hot parathas, lots of cats and friendly waiters. Prithvi has always been a sentiment, an emotion and how rare it is for us to call a cafe close to home?"
The best attraction was the cat. 10/10. Would recommend. Food was good too I guess.
"Prithvi Cafe Restaurant offers an inviting ambiance that complements its delicious menu. The standout dishes like the kulcha aloopyaaz and paneer are certainly the stars here, with their exceptional taste and quality. The veggie delight pizza was satisfactory, and the white sauce penne pasta was quite enjoyable. Although the foods worth the wait, the typical 30-minute wait time might be a downside for some. The restaurant seems to attract a diverse crowd, primarily college students, but youll also encounter couples, foreigners, and a mix of other guests. Overall, its a great spot to savor tasty dishes amidst a lively atmosphere."
"Very nice food , ambience, very tasty. I love it very much"

Interesting.
Very nice ambience to enjoy the delicious  dishes.  tasty foods and best services from the staffs. Very comfortable place with family and friends. I liked the first  experience and will continue.

Best place for food
"Only good for atmosphere, the staff doesnt treat you well if you are not from creative industry, and have just come there to have food"
"One of the shining places of Mumbai. Simple and between the trees sitting arrangements. They have scanners to place an order and payment. Service is amazing. Tried their cheese and chocolate croissant. 4/5 Must try stuff cheese kulcha * 5/5 Blueberry cheese cake* 5/5, (yumm and less sugar, Enjoyed the cake) Orange juice( forgot the exact name) the size was good but 3/5 Vegetarian options: They serve both Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian"
Good one must try
"Amazing ambience, food was lovely, quantity & quality was worth, must try jalapeno poppers and chole kulcha"
The Oreo shake and shawarma was so not good. Very upsetting to see such a quality drop. The Oreo shake just had some milk. Shakes are thick always! This was not even close to that consistency.
The place was too crowded It took 30 mins to get a table and 45 mins to get food after ordering The place is beautiful The food is good but expensive Food : 5/5 |
"Visited this place one of the afternoon of weekdays.. starting from the atmosphere, the interior of the surroundings, and the food order system were different. We have tried chicken biryani,  chicken haryali roll, butter chicken meal, and filter coffee. The taste and quality were amazingly delicious"
Very tasty. The ambience is very lively. I liked the chole kulcha and the chai. Must try in juhu. The cafe has a nice story and is adjacent to the most famous prithvi theatre. Food
"I went to this place with my whole group of friends, max they can accommodate 8 people on one table also the food here was okaish, pizza was thin but very dry, pasta was good try the mix sauce one, rolls were good, biryani was okaish, coolers after good try the lemon mojito,paneer cheese kulcha was very good in taste even though I couldnt find much of paneer or cheese in it. The whole experience was okaish not that great as hyped"
Loved the food and ambience. Children also had a good specially the pizza and cheese balls
"The food was good...ambiance was awesome...staff is too helpful..but the cafe closes very early by 10:30 pm as it is surrounded by residential premises...also there is a long queue in the evenings where one has to wait for an hour or more..also the scanner for queue closes around 9 pm as it is too crowded and the cafe needs to be closed on time...the delivery of order is too quick...the prices are also very much reasonable....you can also place your order online over the table..however, the menu has very limited options...which is an area of improvement..an overall good experience"
Vegetarian options: They do have vegetarian food option. Also taste is really really good. Bakery options are less Food
"Ambiance, good, environment all so lively."
"The place, the food, the vibe here is just quintessential mumbai"
Elegant place with lots of food
Just fantastic....
Best chole khulche in mumbai Super food Dessert is amazing Food : 4/5
Very good food. Wide spread of meals wihch offers good discount. Chole kulche is a must eat. Good cafe to have western and Indian food.
Got the best experience. Which I can not express in my words. Just try once.

It was really a good experience.. food was really nice.. i loved the watermelon mojito.. Its a small cafe but a good one! Would love to visit again! Vegetarian options: There are very few options for vegeterian!
Authentic
"At Prithvi cafe I experienced a new delicious food items with Nice ambience with a coffee. Hoping to go back again and try some food though there are  a lot of options or new and exciting to try. Prithivi Cafe and Theatre is a time capsule of cultural elegance. The coffee is said to be brewed with unicorn tears, creating a concoction that transcends the limits of caffeine. The theatre, with its invisible performers, puts on shows that challenge the very fabric of reality. Legend has it that the entire establishment is guarded by a mystical cat who doubles as the ticket collector. A visit to Prithivi is like a journey through a parallel universe where the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary. I have the best experience in Prithvi cafe, near Prithvi theatre. You can go watch and play, also enjoy the food. The wait was long to get a chair, so I waited for almost an hour. But the wait is worth it. The food was also delicious specially the garlic bread, pasta and Dal makhni   Do visit."
Just amazing   recommended..
Very nice to dine and dishes are very delicious
Very good atmosphere
It is good show to spend some valuble time. The food taste good
The Best Cafe.... Pizza & Pasta are just Wow.... Food
Affordable and jalapeno cheese balls and chocolate waffle was a must try. Service was too good.
"Beautiful place for food lovers, Art lovers and vibe lovers."
Cool place with affordable food. Must try place.
GOOD
Had a family functions for 2 days and everything was awsome ..great staff too ..food awsome ..best wishes allways Wheelchair accessibility: Yes
Excellent
Very good place to visit and eat.
"Prithivi Cafe and Theatre is a time capsule of cultural elegance! Steeped in fictional history, its rumored that the cafe was once a secret meeting place for eccentric artists and time-traveling intellectuals.

The theatre, with its invisible performers, puts on shows that challenge the very fabric of reality.

Already mentioned about this in the previous comments
"Cafe is great and is well managed, you might have to wait for some time during the weekends. It is the problem with all famous cafes, that its always crowded. But I will assure you that the wait is worth it, its outdoor seating makes it worth it. The food is delicious and is served fast and hot. You must visit this place if you are in the are and have around 1 hour to kill. This place is worth the name"
A Must visit place
"Parathas they will never go wrong. Nominal pricing, Good taste, nice ambience, open area. Parking is a problem. Parking: On road parking. Difficult to get"
Have a great birthday here. It was crowded and we had to wait but the wait got over very soon
Very nice
This is the best cafe i have ever seen   must visit
I got to see Nasiruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak because of the ongoing Prithvi Festival. Did not see the theatre but may check it out for something later. The service is prompt and the place does give a vibe of katta where people have intellectual brain storming sessions. An artist did perform on the steps. There are better places for food but this place sells vibe Parking: Its in a gully. And I am guessing that the available parking is only for dignitaries not for the general public. But I may be pleasantly surprised if they showed me a secret valet parking hidden in some automated basement somewhere.
Good ambiance
Irish coffee is must try But waiting list is huge Food
"This is one of my most favourite places in Mumbai. A restaurant made entirely in the lap of nature. You will get to enjoy the cool breeze coming from the sea nearby alongwith the beautiful decor of the place. Just sit, have a cup of Suleiman Tea or Kokum cooler, and enjoy the atmosphere. I always go there when I need to rejuvenate myself but cant take a break or vacation because of work. The prices are damn reasonable and the quality of food is simply out of the world. Have some time in hand because you may have to wait in a queue to get a table."
Very helpful persons and humble response and low budget there
Best coffee place in city
Nice food
It is nice cafe very near to Juhu beach. Must try Irish coffee. Cafe is nice open place with mix crowd and price is also reasonable according to the place Must visit cafe in Mumbai Food
Nice
Amazing place
"Such good vibe, amazing food and service.."
"Prithvi Cafe is a vibe in itself but over the years it has become more of a checklist place because of the hype. We ordered Amritsari Aloo Kulcha, Tea, and Fresh Lime Soda. Aloo Kulcha was amazing but the beverages were okay-ish. The service is lethargic."
Lovely cozy cafe in the same compound as one of the best theatre performance spaces in the city! It has a lovely array of food options which taste delicious. Their Chicken Hariyali Roll is fab! It is all outdoor seating without AC. Kid-friendliness: It is a lovely place to bring your kids or celebrate a party as they have a few larger tables toward the back which gives you privacy as well as doesnt feel clostrophibic.
Food
Good
"Lip smacking items available for very reasonable prices, the beauty of this place is that neither does is vibe change not does its authenticity and taste"
Highly overrated place. We went there after watching reviews but it did not match with our expectations. Food was not good. Only amritseri kulcha was good but egg roll and pav bhaji were disgusting. Place was not clean. No place to park vehicle. No board outside the road.
"This cafe in Juhu is undeniably the go-to spot in the area. Located conveniently next to the Prithvi theatre, its always buzzing with activity, and you might have to wait for a table, but trust me, its worth it. Their tea and samosas in the evening are fantastic, and their Kulcha is simply to die for. The menu offers a wide variety of options to satisfy your taste buds. Keep in mind that theres no parking nearby; youll need to park at Sun and Sand Beach and take a short walk to the cafe, but the experience is definitely worth the effort."
"Lovely place, do have the irish coffee"
One world you can say about this is cool. So many youngsters here. Feel hai boos Food
Good
Good food and hospitality.
Very good service come atmospheee
Great food and vibe at very affordable price
Testy
Good service. Supper...love it
"The taste of food is too gud....,in vegetarian dishes...i feel the home atmosphere thanku u...,u should be try it..."
What a amazing vibes here...and awesome place..
Its very nice recommended to visit
"The only place where I feel nostalgic, good food, good crowd and you get to walk at the beach. No complaints"
"Prithvi Cafe is not just a cafe; its a rendezvous point where art, coffee, and community come together. Whether youre here to indulge in your favorite brew, immerse in the world of theater, or simply soak up the creative vibes, this cafe is a must-visit. Its a testament to the beauty of art and a perfect place to unwind."
Nice place and food
"Place is good, ambience is good well maintained and clean.But need to improve few things in food . Had ordered for Fresh lime soda, chicken croissant,kheema pav,veggie delight pizza and tiramisu. Fresh lime soda was good it was refreshing and properly balanced. Kheema was cooked properly and it was tasty and croissant was delicious. But the pizza and tiramisu was not up to the mark. Base of pizza was so thin that even the edges had burnt and become so hard,there was hardly any sauce and topping on it due to it ,it was so dry to have. Tiramisu which is an Italian dessert doesnt seem to taste like tiramisu. Originally made of ladyfinger(sponge) and mascarpone cheese, both the main ingredient were missing in it. Substituted with chocolate sponge and whipp cream and just dusted with cocoa powder. Not at all satisfied with it."
Hood place to hangout near Juhu
Vegetarian options: Pink sauce pasta Veg pizza Mixed paratha Aloo Paratha Amritsari kulcha White pasta And beverages
"Apart from the waiting queue here which is not less than an hour long, everything about this place is perfect! VALUE FOR MONEY, perfect for a date or a family dinner or even a business dinner. Just that, the place doesnt have AC and the seats are very few. I wouldnt call it disability friendly because the chairs arent exactly comfortable. Moreover their seating section behind is more often than not, not in use. The place is a little cramped but the good part is that its underneath the sky. It serves everyone across socioeconomic and socio-cultural classes. Ive seen people from literally all walks of life come here - from foreign tourists to auto rickshaw drivers."
Pathetic service So rude Food
Lot of rush to get a seat but worth it
Good environment
Food taste and quality is good
Excellent Vegetarian options: Spinach and cereal Food : 5/5 |
Its a Nice experience to be there and enjoy our evening

The charm has diminished. Kid-friendliness: No. Food : 3/5 |
The food was delicious and the ambience was too good. I had great fun with my friends. Good place to chill out with family too. Dont forget to order nachos and cheese balls. I found them very tasty.
Place to hang on
Excellent food quality

Nice experience
Nice Food
"One the best restaurants in this area ,we have tried lunch at this place The food was awesome and fast service and friendly staff"
Good
Very good food at reasonable price.
Mind blowing experience
"Cool open space with affordable food. I had cheesecake as I was early for dinner. It was value for money, good food at reasonable price. It s an open area with cats if you re not a cat person it can creep you out."
Beverages could be better. They tasted like some medicine. Food was good  . Ambience great as usual. Smoking should be banned!
"The vibe of the place is perfect for a chill evening getaway. People come here to experience the filmyness in the air with flavoursome food. Best bid - Irish coffee, Amritsari Paneer Cheese kulche and Biryanis. A live counter slowly letting the Indian spice aromas infuse the ambience Food"
Great place & good food
"Unexpectedly the staff were rude and least bothered. Food was already ready, the staff didnt even bother to check. And so the food was cold and served late to the table even after reminding them. The taste of food was decent but the service of the staff was not at all good."
Amazing chole kulche
very nice place... good food...enjoyed my time here... Vegetarian options: Good place for vegetarian.. mushroom pizza is good. croissants are very good. Food : 5/5 |
Nice place for visiting

One of my favourite place in Mumbai. Food : 5/5
Meh in terms of sitting space. Food was good.
Iconic place
Nice
Amazing Food and Ambience.
Amazing food
"Lovely place to meet friends or have a bite after watching a play at the theatre. Good food, plenty of variety, the only hitch is that it is crowded and you need to wait for a table, but they have streamlined that too. Food"
there were cats! and good food! and lalit prabhakar! need i say more?
Nice place to hang out! Nice and tasty food.
Loved it!
"I had their Aloo Chole Kulche, Chilli Cheese Paratha and Beer-Bottled Chaas. All are a must-try if you love Indian cuisine. It is usually crowded and theres waiting time at almost all times. So be prepared for that."
"The atmosphere was pretty noisy, we had to stand while waiting for our food since there was no place to sit and the food was pretty oily and the paratha was hard kinda rubbery"
Nice place to visit in Bombae especially its menu and ambience
One of the must visit cafe in Mumbai with a very nice ambience and not so expensive menu. Menu offers both veg as well as non veg. The place also has a book store and a theater named as Prithvi theater which was built by Shashi Kapoor in the memory of Prithviraj Kapoor. This place is at a walking distance from Juhu beach as well as Amitabh Bachchans house.
Overhyped. Food taste is average. Far better cafes nearby. If youre lucky you may see some celebrity across threatre  otherwise dont waste your time to go there especially for a meal.
"I came to Prithvi Cafe from all the way to Pune. And it was a disappointment.( my motive was to try good food). The food was so so. I was told the Irish coffee was a must have but it turned out overhyped and I couldnt drink it after a while (maybe I might not have a taste for it so idk Im giving it a benefit of doubt, but still. A normal cappuccino would taste much better.) The arrabiata pasta was nice but then you could get it anywhere else. Amritsari kulchas were good but not worth the hype. We had vertigo pastry which tasted just like any other dark forest pastry, no wow factor in that either. The only plus was we almost saw Imtiaz Ali for a couple of seconds. Overall I would say if you are in the neighborhood and want to spare a couple of hours then its good. Pocket friendly. And overall the vibe was good. Go there for the vibe and not the food."
"The atmosphere is good but the food wasnt, unfortunately"
Artistic Hub!!! Waiting to see Vicky Kaushal around
Amazing experience must visit on weekdays as weekends are jam packed
"Its a really cool place to hangout, and watch theatre. But theres always a waiting for the cafe. 25 minutes, usually. Spend an evening here with play and food here and a walk at juhu beach."
Its a great cafe when its not extremely crowded. The average waiting time on weekends is 40 minutes which is way too much.
Ok
Gg
He
"I had arrabiata pasta meal and croissant. The meal consisted of pasta, salad a brownie and 3 nuggets. Pasta was very bad, nuggets were fine, salad and brownie were good."
All the people can njoy the place very much
"Best place, EVER! And the staff is FANTASTIC. Its like a second home to me.      I always have a bit to eat or something to drink here, when passing by or when Im here for a play at Prithvi Theatre. 5 Stars Food"
"Long waiting period during weekends, but it s worth it , the Amritsar chole kulcha is a must try Vegetarian options: Plenty of veg options"
"If you are around JUHU Try this place, decent with really cost effective price and good quality Food"
Extremely pathetic service. We waited in queue for over an hour just for them to switch off the lights as we started eating. What was even worse than eating in the dark was that the unprofessional waiter insisted us to make the payment while we were eating and tried clearing the table while we were at it. So much that we picked our meals with us and started walking as we were eating. Worst experience ever.
Vegetarian options: Plenty Parking: Paid parking is 250m away. Kid-friendliness: Very
"Tried Tea, Pasta and Kulcha Chhole. Quite tasty."
Amazing ambience and food too
