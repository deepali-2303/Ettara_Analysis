Review
Ordered 2 doughnuts from here via Swiggy but received some coffee instead of that. Its been more than 2 days yet nothing has been done on anyones part all they say is to send mail. If I ordered today and got the wrong order today because of you or Swiggy then why am I being asked to send emails??? I did not pay for some basic cold coffee that I can make at home. I dont know how you plan to run your business if you cant take card of simple orders pathetic.
"Nothing fancy , their coffees could be better"
"Discover the perfect pairing of Tim Hortons signature brews and Biscoff(r)s irresistible cookies, creating a match made in heaven for your Valentines Day indulgence. Let the warmth of the cozy setting and the sweetness of their treats spark joy and create cherished memories with your loved ones. Dont miss out on this delectable celebration of love and connection at Tim Hortons!"
The food & service was quite good.We tried their signature Frozen vanilla cold coffee & hot chocolate has become my new favourite for now The food was yummy too. One of our drink got spilled by my mistake & when it came to their notice they offered a free refill. Also it is a work friendly place with proper wifi access to the customers & charging points as well
"Love their Frozen French vanilla, But a bit expensive."
"After a long wait, Finally India gets the Canadian Coffee Stores. Must try French vanilla flavour Ice or Hot coffee. Salted caramel Donuts  . Food : 5/5"
they dont have tim bits :(
Awesome place!
"Went to this nice chill spot to take a break, while visiting Mumbai for shopping. The menu has plenty of food options for both veg and non-veg. My dad is very particular when it comes to his tea and usually doesnt like any tea from outside, but the staff at the counter recommended a masala kadak chai with milk on the side, which he enjoyed. She was very helpful, understanding and cheerful. The manager was also nice and kept checking on customers to make sure theyre satisfied. Will definitely be going back if Im in town and in the area looking for a quick good bite and coffee (and tea for my dad)."
"Quaint place to hang out and have a good cup of Joe. Amidst all the crowded places, this was a good disconnect from the chaos. Ordered a double double latte, which was decent. I wished it was extra hot, though. Would definitely recommend TH over SBUX."
Hot chocolate - too good.... Classic cold coffee-  perfectly classic !! Food
"Food is okay all sweet n bread not that fun, Americano was xcellent 10/10 visit for coffee and cappuccinos."
Must try tim shake..
"Service slow very slow, super crowded and noisy would.not reccomend if you just want a moments peace with a coffee dont come here"
Amazing place & excellent coffee
Great service and staff was very polite and friendly.
Good place
"Great service pretty ambience , i ordered cafe mocha which i didn t like and the service lady miss yasmine got it changed for me"
"I visited this place early in the morning around 9 am on a Saturday. Since I was here for the first time I tried their most popular beverage and a Tomato, Araguala, Cheese Bagel. Both of them were good. The atmosphere with less crowd was decent and the service was good Vegetarian options: I had the French vanilla and a bagel. They have sufficient vegetarian options"
I loved Kid-friendliness: Very presentable and descent staff heres Food : 5/5 |
"Food was great, service was top notch and the vibe was a great modern version of Tim Hortons. Hafiza was awesome in preparing our food and also in getting our feedback! Food: for our avocado toast in particular, the amount of avocado on the toast was less, but the staff was very accommodating and provided extra avocado on the side. Ordered: maple dipped donut, avocado toast, paneer tikka grilled sandwich, egg cheese and tomato croissant sandwich without tomato, and iced cap original, French vanilla with espresso,"
"The waiting time at this fast food outlet is like waiting for a gourmet meal at a five star restaurant and that might be quicker. Staff are very polite and will continuously keep saying the food is on its way but it gets served a good 20 to 30 mins later. So the buzzer beeps and they hand you the coffee, time is clocked at that, but food takes very long to come. Your coffee is cold by the time the food comes in, defeating the entire purpose!"
Not originally taste Some coffee variety are missing
Gives you the Perfect Cafe experience by serving amazing coffee and bites! Lovely ambience and very good service!
Products purchased wete not up to the mark due to lack of ingrediants but customer service is great
I just love the doughnuts and the coffee here.
Bad Experience
"Located at Linking road in the heart of Bandras  market area. Try the ice cap original. The coffee shop has a nice number of seats. Evenings are packed and night queued up. So go in the afternoon if u want chat up important stuff,bas the crowd is hardly there. Parking is not available outside the shop unless u are lucky. But a little ahead and you may find space. Coffee is regularly charged. But their taste is great so worth. Their snacks and donuts are good too. Staff is super friendly."
Good
"Terrible. With food , parking issues"
Some stuff not worth the price. Avacado Toast was amazing
Love their Frozen French Vanilla with Espresso!
Vegetarian options: Donut Holes are not vegetarian. Food
Yummy donuts
I love their hot chocolate and Caramel Machiatto. I visited it twice for hot chocolate and we also tried its latest Winter Special Gingerbread Hot Chocolate... All so goooddd!!
Service was very polite and friendly.. Walked in and walked out as clean and bright but Location and the store itself are a bit too busy and noisy.. personal preference.
"Great drinks, friendly staff"
Amazing Coffees & Service !
Timbits is a boon with a small ticket size. Extremely delicious. The grilled chicken cheese sandwich is also worth a try bagels were a little disappointing. Service is fine though sometimes staff behind the counter get noisy. But a very concerned and conscious store manager makes up for the service experience with his courtesy. The newspapers help in keeping away from the mobile screen :)
"The food & service was quite good. We tried the chicken tikka croissant, bbq chicken padiana, and timbits. Also we tried their winter special gingerbread frappuccino which was quite flavorful & their signature Frozen vanilla cold coffee has become my new favourite for now. The food was yummy too. One of our drink got spilled by my mistake & when it came to their notice they offered a free refill. Also it is a work friendly place with proper wifi access to the customers & charging points as well ."
"After eating from Tim Horton I realise the franchise is taking against indians on behalf of Justin Trudeau government. I have decided to cancel my visa application to Canada after eating from here. The taste was so bad that I now love my Marwari mom kadi chawal. Menu had everything but taste was nothing, the melt cheese & chicken, chicken tikka croissant and for Gods sake Cream bagel should be sent on trial for being so bad. Finally only good thing about this place is customer service & coffee. As we entered the order receiver at the desk said please pay the bill and go even before she punching in, as she realised that we had taken zomato gold offer of 30 percent off. Now after eating I have realised why people dont pay and go post eating here. Starbucks, Theobroma & Even local Bandra bakery make better food than this joint. Merry Christmas became Marry Christmas after eating due to delusion of food that I have just consumed."
Very warm and welcoming staff with great service!
Good but expensive as the location is at a prime area.
"Taste is okay not that great if you compare it with Starbucks.  Overall average rating, Winter special cold Beverage was not at all good. Java chip was good & Hot coffee was okay, service was slow need lots of improvement"
Great service and coffee. Will revisit
The coffee was amazing
Excellent service by Varsha!
Nothing like Tim Hortons elsewhere - poor quality food (bagel isn t even a bagel). Coffee is mediocre at best. Ambience isn t any better
Very bad customer experience. Ordered for a few things yesterday infact twice and donuts were missing. They didnt even provide me with a resolution.
Nice place
French Vanilla... Out of the world... Amazingg
counter too slow. order taking and making both very slow. first visit but very disappointing.
The atmosphere and the service and  food was excellent
Giant mosquitoes await your presence to feast on your blood. Stay away unless you love getting sick
Loved it
excellent coffee and service by all staff especially Chandrika
The French vanilla is must try and the Kadak chai ( ginger ) turned out to be amazing plus a place with good ambiance
The Maple salted Doughnuts are really nice!
Visited the bandra cafe on numerous occasions whilst staying in the area. The staff are amazing so welcoming friendly and attentive especially Chandrika. The atmosphere is relaxing to spend time there and the food is excellent.
"Lovely sweet staff, love the atmosphere and coffee is obviously why I keep coming back here :)"
Amazing coffee
Bhavini service was very good and polite   enjoyed a lot   hope to see Tim HORTONS again
Great service and friendly staff!!
Must try- Chicken cheese and spicy chicken sandwich. Java chip Frappe. Definitely would visit again! PS: Absolutely DELIGHTFUL cheesecakes and tim-tims (soft balls stuffed with chocolate/blueberry) Food
Love the coffee here...has topped my fav coffee list
Good option
Kid-friendliness: Amazing staff Food
Best experience   after all its a Canadian chain
Good Coffee....good ambience...my son loved the Java Chip
good service and good taste Parking: nothing else Food : 5/5 |
"Tried the world famous Tum Bits, nad if course the ciffe along with the choco chiki donut and pistachio donuts... Found them amazing... Great customer service, specially Ms. Varsha did a fab job. Well done Tim Hortons....!!!"
The Assistant Ms Varsha is excellent. Very customer friendly and is an asset to your Cafe. I wish her all success in your company. Freddie Vaz Service
Varsha was very efficient and helpful!
Lovely coffee & nice snack. Excellent staff. Clean loo. Well done!!!
"This is a paradise for all coffee lovers @Tim Horton at Bandra! The ultimate coffee experience at Tim Hortons cafe, where every sip is a delightful journey through rich flavors and aromatic bliss!    Had Americano and Lotus Biscoff Cheese Cake   which melted in Mouth     Ms Chandrika was warm enough to hep us in trying out different flavours of coffee that took me to caffeine heaven"
the food was amazing as well as its service
"The doughnuts are really worth the hype. The coffee (I ordered a caramel machiato) was underwhelming. The food was okay. Their wraps are good but nothing great to be honest. Their egg and cheese quesadila was really flavorful though. Also, the service is amazing. I even got free timbits! How cool is that!"
Great early morning breakfast experience. I ordered the Peruvian Avacado on Toast Sandwich at around 7:15AM when most other restaurants were closed. It took about 10 minutes to arrive but was worth the wait. The cold cofee I ordered with my sandwich was great too. Highly recommended.
Love the service by Bhavini Mam and love the coffee
Quiet and Pretty ambience
Im from the US/Canada border and so prime Timmy s territory and honestly the quality and selection here def rivals native tim s
The food and coffee was nice
Finally the magic of canada in india
I go every day to bandra tim hortons . The staff is very lovely .the make my drink persfct as i want that the best thing i like of bandra store. There is staff chandrika she make sure i get my coffe perfect every time .
"Thank you for a wonderful experience this morning. This is my first time at a TH outlet in India, and it was very pleasant. At your Dubai outlets, it is so difficult to get a cup of coffee in a coffee mug! I can understand the paper cups to-go, but if a customer wants to enjoy a cuppa in the cafe itself, shouldn t coffee mugs be provided?! Except for your outlets at Deira City Centre & Bur Juman - both of which are happy to provide mugs on request, I don t think any of your other outlets provides this basic requirement! Anyway, back to your Bandra outlet .. well done! Great service & very efficient staff .. special thanks to Bhavini. Hope to be back soon"
Ms. Varsha and Ms. Bhavini were really Great at their Customer Service Skills.... I really enjoyed their new Varient of Pistachio Latte. Thank you. Best Wishes
Really nice experience
"Tim Hortons is the best tasting coffee! Its rich, smooth and the aroma is great."
"Staff at the Bandra outlet are very hospitable, specially a server named Varsha. Food is tasty and portions are quite good. Love the French vanilla coffee."
"Came here during the Diwali season at 1 am. Even then the energy and crowd in this place was as high as a toad. Had my usual Java choco chip latte with a choice of 3 doughnuts. Original Glazed, Boston cream cheese filling and Choco Glazed. The set up is very lit up , literally. Makes it all the more of a happening place. When is this area, would suggest to try this instead of Starbucks."
Nice feel around in the atmos...and extremely welcoming staff...thanks team Tim Hortons Bandra!
"Lovely Atmosphere, Great place to work or hangout"
Vegetarian options: Authentic  and fresh for vegetarian Parking: Easily accessible Food : 5/5 |
Very good place to visit
Very good place
"First time tried this brand, best part is they haven t overpriced the food just because they are selling a white country product - as almost all western chains do. Their sandwiches, bagels, wraps, croissants all cost around the 250-350 mark, so a lunch for 4 of us was around 1500/-. Good stuff. You can relax and sit long. Recommended."
"Always love being here, it s my 4th visit to Tim and it feels like home already. Loved the festive launched shakes, coffee and donuts"
"Coffee, Hot chocolate, Mocha.....tried these....all were liked. Eats and savories were ok, would have liked some healthier options. Good location,  nice and quiet ambience, rather spacious. Food : 4/5"
Good
Good place
Good Ambience Polite staff Tasty food Arabic coffee tastes good Food : 5/5 |
"The hot chocolate and coffee atmosphere here is all good, Free wifi is also available"
"Please dont get Bagels thinking youll get Bagels, its just a bun thats in the shape of a bagel"
Not impressed with their donuts at all !
Smol donut. Big tasty.
One of the best timbits I have had... Better than what I remembered from Canada!
Hyped
"Vegetarian options: Donuts were not available wanted to try them, timbits are must try, specially the blueberry filled Food"
"The French Vanilla Latte with Espresso at Tim Hortons is a delightful blend that beautifully marries the rich essence of espresso with the creamy sweetness of French vanilla. The espressos boldness is elegantly balanced by the smoothness of the frothy milk and the inviting sweetness of the vanilla flavor. The drink carries a comforting aroma and a satisfying taste that is not overly sweet, making it a perfect treat for those who enjoy a harmonious balance between coffee and a hint of sweetness. The addition of French vanilla adds a luscious dimension, creating a drink thats both soothing and invigorating. Its a wonderful choice for anyone seeking a mellow yet flavorsome coffee experience."
"The overall experience of the place is good. Well light, great ambience, friendly faces and polite service. The staff members are well equipped with knowledge and can help well in case you are stuck deciding what to have."
The ambience was very nice and they have good variety for hot and cold beverages.. must try that
Hot chocolate and French Vanilla Beautiful ambience and good service! Food
Canada in our backyard
"Didnt have the drink of my choice, although it was on the menu. Had to get something else. Its rather atrocious that the staff tried to sell something else instead of what I ordered and it has happened multiple times. Asked for the Sriracha Rice Bowl in a wrap (which is on the menu) and they tried to bill a BBQ Rice bowl which was much more expensive! Only when I asked multiple times did they accept it was something completely different and I declined the food. Some of the tables are really low and its a struggle to reach for the drink/food. Summary - Never visiting again"
"My son wanted me to try Tim Hortons Coffee, as he had it in Bangalore Airport. We tried their signature beverage, Frozen French Vanilla with Espresso (Hot) & (Cold). Both were good...The aroma was excellent and so was the flavour. A must visit for all the coffee lovers."
"I had recently visited Tim hortons , I love their  French Vallina beverage not too sweet not too bitter each flavour balanced. However some of the snacks are too sweet for me but if you are a sweet lover then it will be perfect for you. Ambience Vibes are pretty and perfect for date night. Vegetarian options: Mushroom sandwich"
Spidey Vanilla Donught   it is nice.
Very nice ambience. Often come here to work ! Very friendly staff esp Varsha! Good variety of coffee. I like the Double Double Latte! All the best!
"Its similar to the vibe in Starbucks, Third wave. The java chip iced capp and french vanilla espresso were quite good. The timbits are of  flavours - blueberry, chocolate, cookie & cream. These are bite sized snacks which are quite ideal when you dont want anything too heavy with your coffee. The chicken puffs was good too."
The cafe has a good ambience. Quick service and courteous staff are the two aspects about this place that I admire the most. Food taste is good if not the best. I would highly recommend this place for a must visit.
Horton hears a buzz. Time to get his food
Excellent Coffee and Service
No food is prepared by Tims. Except coffee. All food is bought from outside served here
Must try timbits
"This was my first ever Tim Hortans visit and it was pretty average food-wise. The place, staff and service is great. The coffee and food could be better though. I ordered a latte and bagel cheese both of which were just alright. The location is very convenient too."
"tim hortons, located in bandra west. the outlet itself is hugh. the ambiance is delightful. plenty of seating is available. the order was delivered quick, too. they use a buzzer to indicate your order is ready, which i found out to be fascinating and useful. we tried the famous french vanilla. the frozen french vanilla served as a delight to relish upon on a hot scorching sunny day! the staff was extremely polite too. overall a satisfied visit to tim hortons. Vegetarian options: plentiful of vegetarian options are available. Parking: streets are usually bustling. hence it could be difficult to find parking. Kid-friendliness: a good place to bring kids and young adults."
Tim Hortons is in Phoneix market City too. Ticks the Vibe check Had an Almond Croissant which was  very basic. And blueberry donut again okies. Coffee was too good!! Too good!! No debate about that Staff was super helpful with grt HAT.
"Vibe is nice, staff is friendly and I like the quality of food they have."
"SERVICE: Despite having the dine out booked a day in prior, I was kept waiting for 20 minutes with no assistance or proper instructions. FOOD: Way to overpriced for what theyre serving (Brand included). Taste wise its decent. Nothing unique or wowwy!! Atmosphere: Ambience wise you can find lot better places/cafe around and there the food will definitely be better too. Wheelchair accessibility: Well they dont have it from what I can say."
Special mention:- Mr.Akash and Miss Nishtha
"The first coffee shop since arriving in Mumbai, and Ive been a regular customer ever since. Terrific atmosphere, friendly and pleasant staff. The interior is clean and air conditioned. WIFI also available for patrons. Be sure to try their chicken rice bowl. Keep it up. Will definitely keep coming back! Well done and keep it up!"
Nice place
Vegetarian options: The hot coffee was very nice. Food
"One of the best coffee places near Bandra.  Their Cold coffee is a must try, the staff is friendly"
French Vanilla Paneer puff and Avocado Toast are great here Food
Nice Staff
The atmosphere is nice and the maple donuts are delicious.
Absolute rubbish over hyped place. The croissant had no taste and coffee was just about decent and the pastry was hard as stone.
Location: Bandra Pricing: Expensive Parking facility: None Food quality: Very Good Staff behaviour: Average Overall Customer Service Experience: Average Expected a much better ambience given the brands strong presence in Canada. Seating capacity is not much..so youll be lucky if u get a personal table. Parking is a huge pain as they do not have reserved parking or valet parking service. Doughnuts are fantastic and so is the coffee. Quality of food is far better than Starbucks
Great coffee and amazing service from Ubaid
Great hospitality by ubaid
"Decent place...loved the large windows, tall ceiling and simple seating ( not cramped like most bandra joints) Tried the Coffee which was ok but not upto the hype. ( to be fair did not try the bagels or food yet) One of the items frozen french vanilla with expresso was quite  nice. Avoid the iced Java one....too sweet."
Great beverage options & delicious snacking options too. Perfect spot for a quick catch up with a friend.
Authentic coffee experience
Very disappointing..... I have been a great fan of Tim Hortons Middle East & europe... you guys are not even close to that taste and quality.... people coming here giving you 5 stars are all social media influencers and show offs without knowing the quality of a great brand... I had ordered an americano as you guys dont serve brewed coffee and it was nothing but hot water. Nescafe would have tasted better than your so-called arabica coffee.... And then ordered a chicken bagal which was very hard to chew and had to give my entire energy to break it into a bite..... had to throw the entire bagal.....which was a waste. Over all would give you a minus if had an option..... VERY DISAPPOINTING Should be going to Starbucks which is much much better in holding up there name and quality and matching up with the international standards.
"Brought French vanilla latte it was good Tried their bagel chicken patty,it was utter rubbish the bread was stale and the chicken was salty,no value for money. Their Timbits were OK. Overall disappointing. We had the French vinalla over there and had the rest at home,so could not take it back."
Ok food.
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Tim Hortons, and I must say it was quite an enjoyable experience overall. Heres a detailed breakdown of my visit: ** Food: 4/5 ** The food at Tim Hortons is a real treat for the taste buds. I started with their Frozen French Vanilla, and it did not disappoint. It had a smooth and rich vanilla flavor with just the right hint of coffee notes. Served over ice, it was a refreshing way to kick off my meal. For the main course, I tried two different sandwiches. First up was the Chicken & Cheese Melt Sandwich. The sourdough bread was the perfect canvas for the chunky spread of chicken, Cheddar, and grated cheese. It was grilled to perfection with a touch of garlic confit, and the combination of flavors was delightful. Next, I ventured into spicier territory with the Spicy Chicken Melt Sandwich. Again, the sourdough bread was spot on, but the addition of BBQ chicken, green chili, and sriracha sauce gave it a nice kick. While it was enjoyable, I found it slightly less impressive than the Chicken & Cheese Melt. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I ordered a Timbit Box of 10. This assortment of mini donut balls, known as Timbits, was a delightful mix of flavors. The blueberry-filled and chocolate-filled Timbits were my personal favorites, and the caramel crumble and cookies & cream varieties were equally scrumptious. I couldnt leave without trying one of Tim Hortons classic donuts, so I opted for the Boston Cream. This classic was filled with a luscious Boston Cream and dipped in a generous amount of chocolate sauce. While it was tasty, it didnt quite reach the same level of excellence as the sandwiches and Frozen French Vanilla. ** Service: 4/5 ** The service at Tim Hortons was efficient and friendly. The staff took my order promptly, and my food and beverages were prepared quickly. The employees were attentive and made sure I had everything I needed throughout my meal. ** Atmosphere: 3.5/5 ** Tim Hortons is more of a casual, grab-and-go kind of place rather than a sit-down restaurant. The atmosphere is clean and functional, with a focus on fast service. While it may not be the ideal spot for a romantic dinner, its a great place to grab a quick bite to eat or enjoy some coffee and donuts with friends. In conclusion, my visit to Tim Hortons was a satisfying experience. The food, particularly the sandwiches and Frozen French Vanilla, stood out as highlights. The service was efficient, and while the atmosphere was more on the casual side, it served its purpose well. If youre in the mood for tasty sandwiches and delightful coffee beverages, Tim Hortons is a solid choice."
The place is big enough. The service is fast enough for a cafe. We order chicken tikka crossiant and coffee. The coffee was good but the food was not. The crossiant was very dry and flaky. We also ordered a donut and chocolate cake. The donut was good but the cake was dry. The staff just came and asked us on our experience. We mentioned our issues but no action was taken. We didnt expect the quality of food to be this average.
Good ambience  but little pricey avacado should be mashed should have been crunchy
"I visited Tim Hortons for the first time , and I must say, it was a letdown. The coffee(Frozen french vanilla with expresso )was overpriced and tasted mediocre at best. The ambiance was more Instagram-friendly than cozy. Definitely not worth the hype."
"Good ambience. The drinks here are good but the food here is below standards because of the way it had been made. . I ordered for a cream Cheese bagel and a chicken bagel. I was served stale bagels, the cream cheese was served separately like a stone in a bowl, couldnt even be scooped out to spread on the bagel. Both The bagels were stale as ever. The chicken bagel had a chicken cutlet inside the mince had a slight mix of red chilli flakes and salt, bland as ever. I asked to replace the bagels and i was given a replacement of stale bagels again, with absolutely no regret on the counter staff serving me. The second time it was placed on my table with a look of irritation like she is doing the customer a favour. The service and quality here does not deserve a rating. Very poor quality. A very disappointed customer ."
Had a great cappuccino and a cheese & mushroom melt on sourdough bread which was really good Vegetarian options: Good vegetarian options available here.
"Very clean place, delicious fresh food. Staff very friendly and the service was fantastic. I recommend Tim Horton Bandra! Sapna was fantastic & helpful"
My first experience.. n it s nice
very good service
Everything is good The avocado toasts bread was not toasted but the taste was superb We had a good time. Food : 3/5
French cafe is best
Awesomes ambience.. Good quality we can say 10/10. Loved it Food : 5/5
Go places for a coffee or hot chocolate
I ate your food the other day and I feel sorry for it that my money will be used to fund anti India activities by your  country.We Indians call for a boycott.
"I m sorry to say this, but the French Vanilla I had in Halifax tasted totally different from the French Vanilla I had in Bandra."
Excellent service & very professional The taste of coffee   was excellent but not more sugary than an usual Vegetarian options: Yes
Very nice  restaurant
Warm and inviting place with a decent variety. Reasonably priced as compared to Starbucks and quality is also good. Java chip iced cappuccino is a cult favorite. The savoury dishes were delicious as well.
"Had super fun exploring the new coffee place in town ! Welcome Tim Hortons, Canadian cafe chain. Well my staple is Americano (I had an iced one here) I definitely loved it. They have an in-house feedback system so I did give them a review.  We also had titbits donuts which were amazing   !!!! Its a chill vibe Dietary restrictions: They have option for soy milk."
"Certainly not worth the hype that TM created for itself in Mumbai! Something as simple as an Americano was way below average. The double chocolate chip cookie had a very weird chewy texture to it too. What I realized later is that TM is far too expensive compared to Starbucks. Ive made it a vow to support Indian coffee chains, something like Third Wave and Blue Tokai are extraordinary in terms of value for taste and money"
"Its a newly opened branch of famous Canadian cafe tim hortons , I had good experience there having coffee and snacks but it was too crowded when we entered on sunday we have to wait for nearly 10 to 15 mins , so i recommend to visit it on weekdays"
Awesome!  Good to be here for a coffee and a doughnut.
The famous Tim Hortons of Canada. Getting a table may take time in peak hours. The coffees are good no doubt but a special mention for the croissants. They are a must try. Especially the chocolate croissant. Service is quick.
"Well organised.,good quality. This brand and also some others have high priced themselves,lets see how long it.lasts."
"The staff is very unprofessional. And there is this staff named farhan I believe, constantly chewing a gum and I was holding a tray in my hand, none of them bothered to offer me help or give me tissues when I needed it. Instead they were staring at me with more of an attitude and lacking customer service. My friend had to repeat her order 04 times and inspite of it they got it wrong. I understand mistakes happen but the attitude was unacceptable."
Nice to taste the best food.
Great menu and good dishes as per the price list. Excellent longue to hangout
"Recently had the opportunity to visit Tim Hortons in Bandra, and I must say that my experience was quite satisfactory. While it may not have exceeded my expectations, it certainly didnt disappoint either. Firstly, the ambiance of the place was pleasant and inviting. The cozy seating arrangements and warm lighting created a comfortable atmosphere for enjoying a cup of coffee or a quick bite. The staff members were friendly and attentive, ensuring that customers felt welcomed throughout their visit. In terms of pricing, I found Tim Hortons to be reasonably priced compared to starbucks.Overall, my experience at Tim Hortons Bandra was positive but not exceptional. It is a decent spot to grab a quick bite or enjoy a cup of coffee."
Nice place to visit... Coffee and More
"The bagel came cut in half horizontally which made it really easy to apply the cream cheese using a knife. For the first half of the bagel, I made the mistake of applying the cheese little by little before each bite. By the time the first half was finished it occurred to me that that was a very inefficient way of eating it. So, for the second half I applied the entirety of the remaining cream cheese thickly onto the open half of the half-bagel and only then began eating, which made eating it so much easier and made the experience much more enjoyable. The thickness of the cream cheese also was perfect. It looked very hard but when you spread it on the bagel it spreads very smoothly; the firmness of the bagel also helps when spreading them cream cheese cheeks as it (the bagel) retains its shape even if you press hard on it during the process. The visual factor of seeing the knife s zigzag sharp edge creating crisp lines on the cream is also an additional element which adds to the satisfaction of the whole experience. Seeing the lines created by the sharp edge of the knife on the cheese reminded me of those zen sand gardens which have those beautiful and calming patterns on the sand. If you are having bagel and cream cheese for the first time then make sure you eat it the right way from the start. Also, make sure you sit in a place that has high tables. They have lot of low tables which looks good aesthetically but makes it really hard to eat/drink from it. I wish they would make all the chairs and tables as ergonomically efficient as possible instead of focusing on the instagrammability of it."
Good place
A good stop for all coffee lover
Great place with great vibes
"We shared a Cold French Vanilla and Java Chip Frappuccino among 3 people. French Vanilla was nice and basic, however, without espresso Java Chip was too sweet. Staff was friendly but over-friendly at a point. No Croissant & Donut options in veg. Vegetarian options: There are less vegetarian options to eat here, and less veg / vegan options in desserts as well."
Worst experience. Ordered butter croissant and chocolate croissant but it was chewy and cold. Not going to visit again
Honestly I kind of expected more from the brand. The visit I had was fine not a big fan of the coffee and the dessert which my brother had since it was kind of was okay I did not get to try their Frappuccinos maybe they might be good. But it was a one time visit for me.
Very average food and coffee was good
The ambience it s really good and the food is fresh love the way they are adapting pretty well to mumbai needs.
Something New!
Good coffee and I tried salted caramel timbits (which are donut wholes) I loved them Im someone who cant eat the whole donut every time but the Timbits tasted amazing
Good cafe
"Concept, working and functionality is the same as any Starbucks. Though it has well managed and clean areas, washroom and great hospitality. The cost is pretty much the same as other coffee brands and does not stand out as novice to me. Experiencing coffee from around the globe the place is just slightly above average for its options, quality of coffee and ambience. I would recommend it, cause of its location and vicinity to shopping centres and more. Parking can be an issue so please keep this in mind."
I had great expectations from this place but to be frank food was pretty disappointing.Staff and ambience both are very good. I liked the timbits.I ordered a bagel with cream cheese  and also a maple salted caramel doughnut. Both were disappointing.Bagel was so hard I had to gulp it down with two glasses of water and the doughnut was so sweet I couldnt finish it. Overall just ok .
It took quite some time to place the order also it was a weekend so the place was crowded but the food and coffee was good
"Went for breakfast here with high expectations but ended up being disappointed. Their POS servers were not working properly causing orderingbto be really slow. The English muffin and sandwich bread was stale and hard, not grilled or crispy. The pancakes were lacking flavour and also soggy. Finally the staff was overwhelmed with the server issues and ended up talking quite rudely with us. Wouldnt recommend anything here other than French Vanilla and Timbits"
"Tried the much hyped french vanilla at Tim Hortons bandra outlet, only to find it very very sweet. The buzzer system is good where you order and they give you a buzzer which vibrates when your order is ready. Food"
I had ordered classic cold Coffee which  was extremely sweet Which dinot taste good Food
"The ambience and seating is good. Portion size not justified per the price. *Would not recommend veg-wraps* Shakes are good, nothing unusual. Food : 3/5 |"
Food was ok. Service was amazing and so was the atmosphere but the prize makes me wanna never go to Canada ever again. The Canadians have failed me.
"It was my first experience dining at a Tim Hortons. It is a good place to be at, theres a calm yet jovial vibe to the place and the staff is friendly. The coffee is cheaper than Starbucks, thats one. I ordered the cappuccino and it was good, no doubt about it, but there was nothing exceptional about it. The hype of the place exceeds its actual appeal."
Donauts and Tim bits
Worst experiences
"I really liked the signature Frozen French Vanilla and donuts. Service is also good, and the people working there are courteous. I felt that other non signature beverages could use a little work like the Java chip ice cap, however it was also good overall. Would be visiting again soon."
"The business was founded by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League, from 1949 until his death in an auto crash in 1974.[14][15] The first Tim Horton restaurant was located in North Bay, Ontario and sold hamburgers.[16] The chains first donut store opened on May 17, 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name Tim Horton Donuts.[17] The name was later abbreviated to Tim Hortons and then changed to Tim Hortons without the possessive apostrophe. Soon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former police constable in Hamilton. In 1965, Joyce took over the fledgling Tim Horton Donut Shop at 65 Ottawa St N. By 1967, after opening two additional stores, Joyce and Horton became full partners. Upon Hortons death in 1974, Joyce bought out the Horton familys shares for $1 million and took over as sole owner of the existing chain of 40 stores, quickly and aggressively expanding the chain in both geography and product selection. The 500th store opened in 1991.[18] Ron Joyces aggressive expansion of the Tim Hortons business resulted in major changes to the Canadian coffee and donut restaurant market. Many independent donut shops and small chains were driven out of business, while Canadas per-capita ratio of donut shops surpassed that of all other countries.[19] The Horton and Joyce partnership carried on, with the marriage of Joyces son, Ron Joyce Jr., and Hortons eldest daughter, Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce, who were joint owners of Tim Hortons franchises in Cobourg, Ontario until 2023 when the couple retired after 37 years.[20] 1990 2002: Name change and growth Edit Tim Hortons logo as used in the mid-1990s The company had originally been incorporated as Tim Donut Limited.[11] By the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd. This was an effort by the company to diversify the business, removing the primary emphasis on donuts, and continuing the expansion of the menu options as consumer tastes broadened.[18] Some older locations retain signage with the companys name, including a possessive apostrophe, despite the fact that the official styling of the companys name has been Tim Hortons without an apostrophe for at least a decade.[21] The company had removed the apostrophe after signs using the apostrophe was interpreted by some to be breaking the language sign laws of the Province of Quebec in 1993.[22] The removal of the apostrophe allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.[23] Although a number of Quebec locations have bilingual menu boards, the decision to have both Canadian official languages represented is left to the discretion of individual franchise owners. Some Quebec locations have French-only menu boards. It is the strong recommendation to all the Quebec restaurants from the TDL Group Corporation that they post menu boards in both English and French in accordance with the standards being enforced by the Office quebecois de la langue francaise.[24] Merger with Wendys Edit A Tim Hortons/Wendys joint restaurant in Markham, Ontario In 1992, the owner of all Tim Hortons and Wendys Restaurants in Prince Edward Island, Daniel P. Murphy, decided to open new franchise outlets for both brands in the same building in the town of Montague. Murphy invited Joyce and Wendys chairman Dave Thomas to the grand opening of the combo store, where the two executives met for the first time. Murphys success with combining coffee and donuts with Wendys fast food led to the August 8, 1995, acquisition of and merger with TDL Group by Wendys International, Inc., an American company, which lasted until 2009.[25] The sale was widely commented on in the media. In 1995, the Toronto Star had a column reflecting on Tim Hortons selling out to Wendys with the spectacle of another great Canadian icon...gone to Yankee burgerfat.[26] 2002 2006: Regaining independence Edit Tim Hortons franchises spread rapidly and eventually overtook McDonalds as Canadas largest food service"
"Now that a few months have passed since the grand opening of Tim Hortons, the hype seems to have remained constant. Personally found the place to be a little overhyped, but the it wasn t as bad. Their double espresso iced coffee was quite good but I personally really enjoyed their doughnuts"
"Frozen French Vanila is simply the best. If you like the coffee flavour to be strong, you can add a shot of espresso to it. Great ambience. Please do not try the java chip, it will disappoint you."
Good place. Coffee is almost the same as Starbucks. Nothing special as such. But as an international brand it can be experienced once. Apart from coffee i have ordered one passion fruit and kaffir lime mojito which was not at all good .
Do try the frozen vanilla with expresso shot. It s expensive but worth the occasional visit
"Great vibes, but phenomenal wait time for a normal cup of coffee!!"
"When I have visited Canada, Tim Hortons is my favourite place for the best coffee. I love to hang out in  various Tim Hortons outlets with my friends. Happy to see my favourite Canadian Brand is in Mumbai now. Tim Hortons is celebrating its 1st Birthday in India. Tim Hortons is a happy relaxed place that serves fresh coffee, doughnuts, sandwiches and many more fast-food items. Visited Tim Hortons @Bandra  Mumbai. Had my favourite large Double double latte Along with grilled Chicken cheese melt sandwich Yummy chocolate truffle cake - the multilayered chocolate truffle cake piece is the most satisfying experience Happy moments spent in Tim Hortons, Mumbai"
"I really liked the latte and cheese cake. The service was excellent. The place was a little noisier than what we would have imagined, but we were equal contributors to the decibels, and it was a Saturday evening."
The barista didnt ask for sugar preference and over sweetened my cappuccino.

They are Good but personally prefer Starbucks Food
Frozen French vanilla is good
Loved the experience and the service was top tier and especially the hot chocolate was amazing!
Food was good
The food and service was good. If you know Tim Hortons well back in Canada then do visit for the amazing  . Not much variety in Rice bowls but rest stuff is good.
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Tim Hortons, the renowned Canadian coffee and fast-food chain, right here in Mumbai. Nestled amidst the bustling streets of the city, this franchise brings a taste of Canadian flavors and comforting ambiance to the local scene. From the moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by the familiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the warm ambiance that Tim Hortons is known for. The menu boasted a variety of options. I opted for a  cappuccino ,  tim chocolate shake , and  rich truffle slice . The coffee was smooth and well-balanced, a perfect companion for a quick catch-up with a friend or a peaceful moment alone. While the menu included a decent selection of both beverages and food items, I found myself missing some of the seasonal specialties that Tim Hortons is famous for, such as their Tim Hortons Roll Up the Rim contest and various holiday-themed treats. It would be wonderful to see these additions in the future. The seating area was comfortable, ideal for casual meetings or a leisurely afternoon spent reading a book. The bright and cheerful interior, adorned with hints of Canadian culture, added to the overall experience. However, I did notice that during peak hours, the place could get a bit crowded, leading to longer wait times for both ordering and receiving food. It would be great if they could streamline their service during busy periods. All in all, Tim Hortons in Mumbai offers a pleasant escape into Canadian flavors and culture. The cozy ambiance, friendly staff, and a taste of their signature offerings make it a delightful spot to enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack. While there is room for improvement in terms of service efficiency during peak times, I left with a contented palate and a sense of having experienced a slice of Canada in the heart of Mumbai."
Overrated place
At busy hours only one counter in service long line people waiting /food average .. And mostly all food stock out no backups Food

"Tried there double double latte, tim bits blue berry and salted caramel are op And french vanilla with espresso shot is awesome Food"
Very cool place to visit for enjoy & work purpose
"The place is very good. You get a token, when it buzzes you come to know you have your order is ready so you get so see something new. Bit expensive but tasty. I m also adding the videos and photos of the buzzer and menus so it s easier to decide earlier. Had Frozen French vanilla with espresso which was great."
"Trying , and great attempt but far from the quality offered in Canada. Starbucks quality all over the world is exact same . This isn t. Fix it"
Good place for coffee. Fast service
We tried the Java chip frappe. It felt more like a chocolate shake rather than a coffee based beverage. I liked the Starbucks one better. Cant say in regards to their other drinks as I didnt try any.
"Since have been a regular customer of Canadian Tim Horton (10+ years), experience at tim Horton in Mumbai was very different (in disappointing way)... French Vanilla was too dilute... All timbits are alike except for surface coating and fillings... But maybe this is the menu they finalized upon after relevant Indian market servey... I wish them best...."
Must try - French Vanilla in any form hot or cold. Sandwich is not that tasty. But its fresh. Vibes are appealing. Total Solo or Work Place. A cosy warm place where you can sit for hours and hours to chit chat or working mode.
"Tim Hortons consistently delivers a delightful culinary experience. Their aromatic coffee, brewed to perfection, is a comforting start to any day. The menu boasts an array of delectable treats.

"I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Tim Hortons Lokhandwala branch, where the donuts, coffee, and desserts left me thoroughly impressed. The assortment of donuts was a feast for the eyes and a treat for the taste buds. Each one was soft, flavorful, and topped with delightful combinations of glazes and fillings.

The quality of food is amazing. loved the ambience. We really love Coffee this was one of the best places I have been to for coffee."
Good coffee in the town taste was good
I just love this place! Java chip and french vanilla is a must try: Visit now and try out their amazinggg coffee and snacks available in a wide range:)
I had cappuccino with chocolate balls. Its a brand and damn costly for average person. Anyway you can only see upmarket people there.
"It was really worth trying tim Hortons for my 1st time , this banana shake was worth trying and would be my new fav if to say, the ambience as well as the service was too good , also the staff was really friendly"
Beautiful food and coffee Very satisfying Thanks Chandrika go girl Food : 5/5
I visited this place yesterday and had amazing experience. I tried their vanilla coffee for the first time & I m surprised it taste so good. perfect place for brunch date. Highly recommended !!
The coffee is really awesome also the sandwich was tasty.
Had a great time at this place. Love the atmosphere and vibe . Didn t know that they have these many options in food too. Beverages and food are so soulful. Loveeee it!
"Love their signature coffee, iconic beverages & delicious food! My favourite is the the Iced Capp with vanilla -- a blended frozen coffee beverage with ice cream on top. Definitely worth a try!"
"Most horrible experience,  ordered thru Zomato and paid 5000 bucks and almost half of the order was not delivered. First impression is last impression and Tim hortons Bandra is proved it. Thug employees"
"Went for java chip and literally they was not have whipped cream in stock, so I suggested him block this item untill becomes available or Give some discount to customers but they denied and told us whipped cream used only for presentation. and we also given money only for that presentation only. Croissant also very soft and filling of veggies came outside after first bite. i am bit confused its really original store of canadian brand Aur Yeh Chale Hai Starbucks   se Competition karne"
Must go for a good coffee break!
Was there early this am for a coffee and a parcel order of 10 veg paneer puffs. Good coffee and my friends enjoyed the puffs about a couple hours later. Opens at 7am with friendly staff.
"I recently happened to visit this place and I must say its quite good. I had a drink named Frozen french vanilla espresso (it was well balanced, both on the sweet and bitter side) and I had a blueberry cheesecake donut which was too good. The donut was very very soft and the filling was oozing out. The donut was on the sweeter side and those who love too sweet should definitely give it a try. The ambience is warm and pleasant and the staff were polite and friendly. Vegetarian options: At the time I visited, in desserts there were no vegetarian options. Parking: Theres no alloted parking as such."
