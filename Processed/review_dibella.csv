Review
Any waffle you order here has to be amazing and in Coffee section hazelnut coffee was great.
Its a good place for a cup of coffee .. snacks are a bit on expensive side...overall ambience is nice ..for working
Excellent
all good but pls ask water at least
Good place to have a cup of coffee
"Just want to  tell you that this place is super,nice coffee and great hospitality. By  Sneha ,keep ask for Sneha for good hospitality.....want to  come again"
"We ordered hot chocolate, eclairs latte and mocha frappe .All the things were really not what we expected and it all costed about Rs 300 which is so expensive. The hot chocolate was like hot milk nothing else. The eclairs latte didnt had any eclairs flavour and the mocha frappe was just classic cold coffe. Really disappointed.Very bad experience."
Perfect Experience
"I love the atmosphere here, they have the open air space as well...I love the hot chocolates here the waffles are good too all in all I love being here"
Ventilation sucks
Just passed by and it seems to be ik
"Worst service ever. Even after waiting for 1.5 hours youll not get your orders. And they wont even bother to bring your order, even water, after asking multiple times. The manager just yells at employees and theyre not even trained properly. Horrible service. I wish I could have reviewed on food also, only if they had bothered to give us"
Its expensive
Easy atmosphere..friendly ready to help staff..
"Simply Pathetic!, rude behaviour, disregard of customers!"
Great ambience with a sea side location. Great space and sitting area. A good place for meetings. Vegetarian options: Has options Parking: Find  suitable one Kid-friendliness: Yes
The worst lemon ginger tea I have ever had!! Place was full of mosquitoes! Zero marks! Food
"Pet friendly place for sure,"
Cold coffee is average and so is the ice tea. But the blueberry milkshake is nice and so is waffle
"A wonderful afternoon in the middle of August 2023, is when i walked into the versova location of coffee di bella, sat at the corner table to the left, as you walk through the glass entry door, and soaked in a 270 degree experience of the place. Special thanks to the coffee by di bella team for adding a dairy free item to the dessert menu, and Ms. Sneha maam, and Mr. Hemant sir, and Ms. Yash sir, for a top class dine-in experience. Will keep coming back for more"
coffee is worth trying
"Di Bella used to be my go-to spot, but theyve missed the mark several times now. The coffees are underwhelming, the shakes and cold beverages are average, and it seems like theyre too aggressive in cost cutting while still being quite pricey. The service is nowhere near what Starbucks offers, and the menu feels quite limiting, too."
The food options are fairly limited and the masala tea was not at all satisfactory but the service is good and they have good coffee. Parking is a challenge during peak times but available during other times.
Its all about delicious coffee... Kid-friendliness: Kids Food : 5/5 |
Great place
"Little disappointed Lemon honey green tea, very bland Exterior Terrace looking little old Food : 3/5"
Awesome place good coffee but not maintained properly especially outdoor
Kuch khass nahi hai.. coffee toh wahiyat hai
Its just beside the beach. Wonderful coffee options. Perfect date spot. Food : 4/5
Ordered 2 traditional soy hot chocolate and it tasted very bad even after getting it changed. The soy milk was spoilt i think. I have the same thing in different branches and it tastes fine.
Good place to hang out
Yummy waffle ice cream. Kids loved it but as usual charges little high. Kid-friendliness: Kids will love waffles Food : 5/5 |
"Absolutely rubbish place to have a coffee and relax. I visited yesterday, and was seated for 15 minutes at a table in the open area, and surprisingly no waiter  visited my table to take my order. It was not that the cafe was very crowded, in fact one waiter was leisurely loitering in and out, but he never cared to approach me and take my order. I would never ever go to this cafe, given the fact that there are 10 more cafes in the proximity of 100 metres."
Staff is pathetic..dont knw how to treat the customer.very disappointed..have been to other outlets but bad experiences wid dis versova outlet..not gonna visit deir Eva again..
Shabby and runs down ... Cleanliness is lacking  .. service takes too long
"Pet friendly cafe with great selection of coffee,shakes and sandwiches."
Lovely place for coffee dates
"Decent place to spend your evening working in a cafe Had - Waffle with Honey & Ice cream - waffle was quite fresh Chocolate Frappe - wasn t upto the mark Recommended dishes Peri Peri Chicken Sandwich, Veg Club Sandwich"
Everyday I go and i feel relaxed in varsova bich
Excellent service by friendly and efficient service. Great coffee etc. Seating inside and outside
Friendly and efficient service. Seating inside and out. Very good coffee and food available. Dog friendly. Close to the beach with entrance by the sidewalk. Food
Very sweet staff. Great service
"Good food,quick service. Moneys Worth ."
"Nice place to have  a coffee at versova just near to the beach. Looks small from outside, but seating arrangements are plenty inside."
Superb coffee !! Hot chocolate done by Maya is awesome and the service by Vishal is the best .
Visited versova branch and the table service done by mohd tauqeer was great and the freakshake made by vishal was just mouth watering its definitely worth giving a try
Good place. Great service by Trilok.
My favourite evening hang out place with friends
"Bellas Coffee, Machlimar, J P Road,Andheri West."
"Asked them to make a black tea for me since it wasnt in the menu and Saquib very sweetly said hell make something for me. Man, what an awesome ginger tea he made for me. No milk no sugar, just some honey and the tea was so refreshing"
"I ve been visiting here from a very long time, and everything was just fine but now the food quality is just degrading with every experience i am having recently. The chicken pasta that i had today was the worst pasta I ve ever had. The chicken was hard and not fresh and i ate just a little from that but still got stomach ache just 10 mins after! Never coming again!!"
Good
The service at this place is excellent ...
Great hangout place in versova
Lovely place with extremely good service
Next to versova beach
"Loved it totally the best hot chocolate of my life, tried the Nutella Hot Chocolate the taste is totally ultimate level! Anyone visiting the shop should try this Australian brand Hot Chocolate!"
These people should consider cleaning their washroom.
Amazing coffee and food
"This is the pathetic place where washroom not clean, water supplies are not proper."
Versova JP road ! Awesome  food for a hungry day ! Faisal recommended Nutella hot chocolate and club sandwich that were SUPER tasty indeed .
Amazing service by Faizan
"Best Cafe by Di Bella branch!! My happy place, been a regular customer here only because of the best hosting n customer service by the wonderful manager Faizel Sheikh. Great Vegan options n great ambiance, perfect for meetings, sitting solo or hanging out with friends.. Vegetarian options: Everything is wonderful but please add Vegan eatable options"
"The staff named Faisal and Vishal are very cooperative and humble towards me and my colleagues. Also the Sydney pastry was awesome. I am in   with this place. The ambience, the surroundings give lot of positive vibes to me and my colleague to work. Thanks."
Awesome pastry taste and all staf are polite and friendly special tankful to Faizal for suggestions of Sydney pastry really good place to visit
Nice place to hang around
Nice ambience and a good coffee makes it a best place to enjoy your favourite beverage.
My peace palace Parking: No space outside for parking Food : 5/5 |
Extremely poor experience when ordered a simple Masala chai. Was watery and absolute minimum taste of actual good chai. Completely below standard for an Australian coffee shop! Food : 1/5
The coffee is standard the wifi is good and the charging ports are a gift for anyone working on their laptops! The service exists with a smile and you have to love that! The place has a great atmosphere and very beautiful ambiance
Near varsova beach
Nice ambience with pocket friendly rate s on a very prime location of Rocks versova ...must go place
"Sandwiches are very good, beyond expectations. Coffee is like any other high end cafe. Overall a good place to hangout."
Had a lovely time. This is a perfect place for frappe lovers. It has a soothing ambience which calms the mind. They serve lot of different types of dishes too. Their veg club sandwich is must try!! The frappes were delicious. The service and staff was friendly and attentive. Overall had a wonderful experience.
Its unnecessarily expensive and the service is not upto the mark as for the money we are paying.
"Not at all liked, wastage of money"
"Food and drink is good,service is delayed."
"The big plus point about this place is, beach is nearby. Their peri-peri fries are good. Also, you might have to ask for sugar if youre ordering latte or cappuccino coz they did not serve me one which by the way i didnt even ask for as i dont like sugar in coffee. What a coincidence, no? The staff who attended us (abbey, haan akela nahi tha me  ) was super friendly. By super friendly i really mean it. It felt like he already know us from long back, tho I went there for the first time. You might have to keep an eye on washroom door, if you want to use it. Only one person can use it at one time. Anyways I had a great time there! I hope you will too have a nice time and experience there. Keep sipping, keep smiling Happy Coffee-ing"
Loved a service
Loved the ambience the convince of ordering from the menu
Good moment you enter you get the coffee smell soo refreshing and good
A beautiful cafe with amazing waffles and shakes. Its a heaven for people with sweet teeth. Their freak shakes are so filling and are so grotesque. And the waffles are so soft and chocolatey. My overall experience here was just too great. The place is a little on the expensive side but I would say it is worth it
"Near to the beach,nice place to hangout"
I like the food and Coffee here. Have been visiting this Place Quite often. Good Place to Chill and Talk. and Seen Strugglers of Film Industries. Hope they get work....you can eaves drop to their conversation to know how weird they are the entire Film Fraternity. Fake to the Core
Kid-friendliness: Ample space for kids to sit around
Best coffee beautiful location love it thanks team coffee by di Bella
Just ok. Over priced. Coffee not so good.
Location is good
"The versova branch was one of my favourite di bella branches. But recently i have noticed the drop in the quality of their food and also of their ambience. I had visited the place on 7-8-22. And had ordered waffle. The waffle was not like the usual one. It was very hard, taste of old batter being used and awful after getting slight colder. After consuming it I was feeling nauseous and had been not in good shape till today, i have been repeatedly puking my gutts out and really on bed ever since. I would like to get an apology for the same and really would not like to visit the branch ever again. The other issue being their toilet is very very awful the water is spilled everywhere, no dry tissues, sometimes shortage of water and pathetic door knobs and odour. Really really bad to see the branch getting dramatically low in their standards."
"One of my favourite place in versova, Mumbai"
"Rating 1 because of basic thing not working i.e AC. AC is not working since last 2 months and its pathetic cant meet more than 1 person at a time. Coffee is ok, not that good ... Ac theek karwa lo pls"
Wrong Location. They have moved. The 1 star is for not updating the location not for the food.
Very joyes experience. As its close to versova beach so will have to wait for seats. Quick service and friendly staff. They help to customize your order according to your taste.
We were here on a lazy weekend afternoon. It s conveniently located and the crowd is decent. We did not order any food but my dark hot chocolate was really good and apparently so were the coffees. The service was as expected but shout out to Vishal for being extra helpful. Go here for the quintessential chain coffee shop experience without much hassle.
Vijay did a superb service at the counter today evening
Best Turmeric Latte
Good ambience
Very good food.excellent service given by vishal
Good cafe
Must try shake at coffee by di bella Melbourne frekshake  ! The shake was amazing! Thanks saket for making so lovely shake
Thanks to Vishal for suggest us to order A new Oreo Butter scotch Frappe it s very yummy in taste
Drinks were Good in Taste.. Service could be even better if served a little faster and promptly
Awesome
Had been to this place pretty late at night around 12:30am. They staff was really helpful and very approachable. Their coffee was also good. We had ordered a cappaccino and a classic cold coffee. Both were really good. This outlet is very close to the Versova beach. Though a bit expensive but overall good.
Cool place to hangout with friends
Vishal was excellent in her service Taj chef was magnificent on his food prepareration Alwsys a pleasure to come and Bette see by Vishal 5 star to ur outlet
Good

Nice place for great coffee and waffle options

I ll give you 5 stars because of your employee named Vishal... He serves instantly and he is very good in approaching new things to the customer... Keep it up Vishal... Because of him Im your everydays customer
Loved the mango freakshake they served. Super yummy!! And a must try here. Thanks to Vishal for making it a special experience.
One of the best cafes to work from. Staff is really Friendly. Raila is really calm and gives out a good vibe to the customers.
Their was no menu they were asking to scan on table for menu card is that stress we hav to take to just get your menu card  very bad experience  very bad quality of cofee earlie when I had it at juhu verso it was good in taste but here it was pathaetic.
Nice place for having coffee..
Imtiaz and Chef Mandar gave a great service. Nice place to visit
Amazing coffee. Especially their hazelnut flavoured black coffee. Nice quite place to have breakfast and they open quite early.
"Coffee by Di Bella, is a popular coffee and waffle chain which has a presence in Mumbai, so I was extremely disappointed to see a tiny and chaotic outlet with cramped seating (it feels as if the tables are piled on top of each other). I went ahead and ordered anyway, hoping I d be impressed with the food. So, I ordered a regular Kibana smoothie after the waitress s recommendation and expected a robust flavour (all I got was absolutely NO flavour) and an Organic Maple waffle. The waffle wasn t as disappointing as the smoothie, but overall it was a bad experience. From poor service to the tasteless shake, I wondered what the hype was all about. As I left the outlet, I vowed never to step in again."
Imtiyaj Had awasome tea and coffee with fries Suggest pastry choclate traple  that was awesome
Imtiyaz.. great service...thank u so much
Very good staff. Had mind blowing dutch truffle pastry. Will definitely visit again.
"Great ambience, clean place with indoor and outdoor seating. Though the chocolate pastry we ordered was very dry and didnt look fresh."
Service was great Thankyou so much
Nice place for a good coffee and peaceful chat....
Imtiyaj and vishal good service thank you for a lovely coffee special thanks to imtiyaj for suggestions
Worst Lemon tea... Exorbitant prices... All they did was pour hot water in a cup with a tea bag. No flavour... No taste... Whatsoever.
"Superb location. Open seating.  Never too crowded. Always get a place to park my super bike (right where I can see it) , lovely food / coffee and courteous staff. What else can u ask for ?"

And I was absolutely delighted with brownies. Soft, creamy and incredibly delicious brownie. I will definitely come here again."

Amazing service by Imtiyaj. Love the hot Chocolate and the waffles. The Nachos are too good.
"NOT A SPECIALITY COFFEE SHOP! The Baristas are untrained, the coffee is terrible. The Barista insisted on giving me a lecture on Flat Whites while I was in the middle of a business meeting. Food is alright if youre fine with your meal reheated in a microwave."
"We had the chicken pasta. The pasta made by Shubham was great. The service provided by Vishal, Imtiaz and Abhishek was amazing."

Best coffee place and they have the best waffles
This place has shut down.
Earlier for years they had a joint called Chai Coffee here. They were known for great Chais and coffees and superb service. This place unfortunately lacks all of the above. Unfortunate! Service is extremely poor. Go at your own risk.
Order only through app.
Lavish cafe
"Nice location, with above average customer service. The open area is quite pleasant."
Had fantastic service by Navjot at Di Bella in Versova. He recommended a great drink and was very attentive and kind. Service like this makes a big difference in the experience. Thank you.
Nice coffee at  midnight and till late 1 am . Nice cappuccino  and expresso shots. Complementary cookies .... Location is beautiful at Versova .........
Coffee at this place tastes always best. Bt service was poor..
"Super Oz coffee, friendly staff Imtiaz, Shane and Mahendra..Cheers"
"The staff and the manager is very rude, they are not oriented to the services business. With such a poor service, they ll see the closure very soon ."
"I Have Visited Some Branch OF CBD But This Is Now One Of My Favourite ! Location Is Amazing , Staff Are So Kind Yaaa And Test Is As Always Delicious !"
"==================================== SOME REALLY GOOD WAFFLES BOSS! Visit Dish: Ultimate Chocolate Waffle Explosion, Apple Pie, Cappuccino Ambience: The Place is cozy but small. It is well maintained with nice seating. Since it is the rainy season, the outdoor seating was limited. The place is good for quick bites. Service: I found the service to be slow. It was below par as far as taking Order and billing is concerned. Besides that, the dishes came in quickly which was good. Food Experience: The Apple pie was less sweet with a soggy base. If it would have been a little sweeter, the dish could have been good. The Waffle preparation was the hero. The chunks of marshmallow just blended perfectly with the Nutella and the chocolate waffle. The whipped cream with strawberry syrup was great and tasted exceptional with Nutella and waffle. The addition of banana just enhanced the flavour and aroma of the dish. The Cappuccino was made excellently. It was nice strong with a tinge of chocolate served alongside. The rusk-biscuit accompaniment has a strong aroma of cinnamon and tastes great. ===================================="
Earlier it was Chai Coffee. No doubt current place is also good.
Great place to chill and hang out with friends! Items on the menu are reasonably good.
"Its a great place to chill and have your favorite beverage. I really like the ambience all clean and tidy. Bright and shinny. Perfect for a date, one of the few places in Versova can give this kinda facility. Also it is so near to the Versova Beach so you can always catch the sunset or go for a walk after a great day of work. Food quality is also decent not that good, I have taken one star away for this specific reason rest everything is great!"
Excellent
Service was good. Coffee looked and tasted quite toasty and fine. It could have been hotter but they were partially open So I can overlook that. All the best and congratulations.
"Its nice place, with good selection of coffee, but the service needs to improve"
Staff were very friendly
Nice service
"Clean, peaceful and amazing taste"
Cleanliness is an issue

Good service and great food with some amazing coffee
"Coffee by Di Bella is a nice spot to have croissants, the croissant pastry is buttery and flaky and absolutely delicious with their various filling options!! I especially like the cheese croissant they serve. They also give you a complimentary waffle for your Birthday :)"
Nice place to meet friends over coffee..
The ambiance for couples is good inside and friends can hangout outside in open area with a big sitting capacity. They make wonderful waffles and the kit kat shake i had was really awesome. It was thick full of kit kats and chocolate.
"Nice place to meet your friends , serves good coffee"
The food is quite ok
Nice cosy place to have coffee with friends or family. Prices are a higher compared to other coffee shops.
"Iced Americano, Waffles and Puffs are must try."
Excellent coffee....the person who made it...really knows what a strong cup of coffee should taste like unlikeost places... Preeti...thank u for a good start to my day
Nice place to chill
"The place is pretty clean and attractive. The service is good. Food menu and the beverages is of premium quality. Different shake flavors with the whole new taste. I ordered hot chocolate and red velvet shake, which includes essence of coffee. Didnt expect that would taste super good."
Place where rich kids usually visit
Must have is their Masala Chai
"Good service, great food and love the coffee."
"Coffee was excellent, no cheap almost like in Sydney. Only servi was a bit slower."
Good place for a quiet get together
Best waffles in the city
A place to grab a coffee with friends on a sunny day
Good desserts

If you go here make sure to try the roasted almond truffle...its the bomb!
The services have gone a notch down as we took the outdoors seating but our order wasnt warm And I doors wasnt very clean
Nice
A great place to catch up with friends over some really good coffee. Highly recommended.
Love the ambience
A good place to meet friends over coffee. A bit expensive. Still nice.
